The Invisible Living 
World: 
Beyond Our 
Naked Eye
Probe and ponder
 
Have you ever wondered what you might see if the invisible 
world around you became visible?
 
How do you think your observation of this hidden world might 

change the way you think aboutsize, complexity, or even what 

counts as ‚living™?
 
Have you thought how these tiny living beings interact with 

each other?

The human eye can only see objects that are above a certain 
size. For a long time, many tiny things around us remained 
unknown. Long ago, people discovered that a curved piece of 

glass could make small things look bigger. The piece of glass 

was shaped like a lentil seed
 
Š
 
thick in the middleand 
thin at 
the edge
 
Š
 
hence they called it a 
lens
. Over time, lenses were 
improved to become more powerful. Each new tool, from simple 

magnifying glasses to microscopes, helpedhumans see what 

their eyes could not. The invention of the microscope opened 

a fascinating hidden world filled with tiny living creatures. We 

will 
explore 
some of these life forms in this chapter.
You have already learnt about the amazing variety of living 
beings. Just look around
 
Š
 
there are so many 
beautiful plants 
and animals! They are of all shapes, sizes, and colours. Some 

living beings are tiny, while others are really big. They differ not 

only in their structure but also in many other features. All these 

living beings, whether plants or animals, are called 
organisms
. 

Have you ever noticed the smallest organism around you that is 

visible to the naked eye? Thinkabout it
 
Š
 
howsmall a thing 
can 
your eyes actually see? 
You might have seen some people using reading glasses. How 
does it help them see better? Or what happens when we use a 

magnifying glass to 
observe
 something?
Activity 2.1: Let us observe
 


Fig.
 
2.1. Fill it with water.
 
 
 

the letters through
 
it.
Do you 
notice something interesting? The letters 
appear larger when seen through the flask! This 

happens because the flask filled with water acts like a 

magnifying glass. Now, use a real magnifying glass to 

look at small organisms, like an ant. Were you able to 

see the details of its body more clearly?
For a long time, people were curious to explore the 
tiny organisms around them,but they could not see them 

with their naked eyes. So, how did we finally discover 

this invisible world? Do you know which scientific 

discovery helpedus see the tiny world for the first time?

Ever heard of ...
In 1665, a scientist named Robert Hooke 
published a book called 
Micrographia
. He 

was a careful observer, and a skilled artist. 

In this book, he showed detailed drawings 

of tiny things that people had never seen 

before
 
Š
 
things he saw using a tool we now 
call a microscope.
His microscope madethings look 200 
to 300 times bigger, than 
what one could 
see with the unaided eye. One day, he 

looked at a thin slice of cork and saw it 

was made of many small, empty spaces. 

These compartments reminded him of a 

honeycomb. He drew what he saw and 

called each small space a cell. This was the 



to describe the basic unit of life.
Around the same time in 1660s, Antonie 
van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist, made 

better lenses that allowed himto build more 



to clearly see and describe tiny living things 

like bacteria and blood cells.  Because of this, 

he is known as the Father of Microbiology.

2.1 What Is a Cell?
All living beings are made up of 
cells
. You might wonder what 

cells actually look like. Let us take a closer look at the basic 

structure of a cell using a microscope.

Activity 2.2: Let us study a cell  
(Teacher demonstration activity)
 
Take an onion bulb from your kitchen or garden and wash it 
thoroughly with water.
 
Cut the onion bulb vertically into pieces.
 
Take one piece of onion and pull out the thin, transparent 

layer from its inner surface with the help of forceps. This 

layer is called the onion peel.
 
Place the peel in a petri dish containing a few drops of 

safranin (red-coloured stain) for 30 seconds. This will give 

a pinkish colour to the cells and help us see them clearly.  
 
With the help of thin brush transfer the onion peel to another 

petri dish containing water to rinse 

the peel and remove extra stain.
 
Now, carefully place the stained 

onion peel on the glass slide using 

a thin brush, ensuring it does not 

break or fold.
 
Put a drop of glycerin over the 

onion peel on the slide. The 

glycerin will prevent drying of the 

cells and improve clarity for better 

visualisation of cells. 
 
Slowly place a coverslip over the 

peel using a needle, such that no 

air bubbles get trapped.
 
Use blotting paper to gently wipe 

off any extra glycerin around the 

edges of the coverslip.
 
View the slide under a microscope 

or a foldscope. 
Compare
 it with 

Fig. 2.3c.
 
 

Fig. 2.3c and Fig. 2.3d?
You will observe nearly rectangular 
structures under the microscope. These 

are the cells of the onion peel, which 

are closely arranged without any space 

between them. Try to observe the peels 

of the leaves of different plants around 
yo
u. You will find that all plants are 

made up of cells. Whatdo you think 

the body of an animal is made of?

Activity 2.3: Let us investigate
 
Rinse your mouth with clean water.
 
Use the blunt end of a clean toothpick, and gently scrape the 
inside of your cheek.
 
Place the scraped material in a drop of water on a clean glass 

slide and spread it evenly.
 
Add a drop of methylene blue (a blue-coloured stain) over 

the material on slide. Adding stain improves the visibility of 

the material under the microscope by increasing contrast.
 
After one minute, add a drop of glycerin over the material on 

the slide to prevent the cells from drying.
 
Now, carefully place a clean coverslip on the material, and 

remove the excess glycerin from the edges of the coverslip 

using blotting paper.
 
Observe the slide under a microscope and draw what you 

see in your notebook.
What did you observe? You will observe a polygon-
shaped structure as shown in Fig. 2.4. These are cheek 

cells, which form the inner lining of your mouth.
What similarities and differences did you observe 
between the cells of onion peel in Activity 2.2 and 

human cheek cells in Activity 2.3? 
You have observed that cells have three main parts
 
 
Š
 
athin 
outer lining, a central region, and a small 
round structure inside it. The outer layer is called the 

cell membrane
. The round structure in the middle is 
the nucleus, which is also covered by a thin membrane. The space 

between the cell membrane and 
nucleus
 is filled with 
cytoplasm
. 
These three
 
Š
 
cell membrane, 
cytoplasm, and nucleus Š are the 
basic parts of a cell. Some cells, like onion peel cells, have an 

extra outer layer called the 
cell wall
. What is the importance of 

these structures in a cell? What functions do they perform? Are 

these functions important for the maintenance of life?
The cell membrane encloses the cytoplasm and nucleus. The 
cell membrane separates one cell from another. It is porous and 

allows the entry of materials essential for life processes and the 

exit of waste material.
Cytoplasm contains other components of the cell and 
compounds, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and mineral 

salts. Most of the life processes take place within the cytoplasm.

The nucleus regulates all activities that occur within the cell. 
It also regulates growth.
The cell wall in the plant cell provides rigidity and strength 
to plants. This is why all cells are arranged compactly with each 
other and look firm in structure.
A step further
Cells in all parts of a plant have tiny rod-shaped structures called 

plastids
.
 Some plastids, like 
chloroplasts
, contain chlorophyll, which 

makes them green and helps in photosynthesis. In non-green parts, 

they help in the storage of substances. Plant cells also have a large, 

empty-looking space called a 
vacuole
. This helps the plant cell store 

important substances, get rid of waste, and maintain the shape of 

the cell. This gives strength and support to the plant. In animal cells, 

vacuoles are usually not present, if present, they are usually small. 

These small vacuoles store certain substances dissolved in water 

(Fig. 2.5). So, a cell is not just a simple bag of liquid
 
Š
 
itis 
a complex 
structure made up of many different parts, each with its own special 

function to allow the cell, and in turn the entire organism to work.

We have now understood the basic structure of cell. And we 
now also understand that plant and animal cells differ in shape and 

structure.
Do different animal cells also vary in their shape and structure?
2.1.1 Variation in shape and structure of cells
The 
muscle
 cell and the 
nerve
 cell of a human are shown in Fig.
 
2.6a
 
and (b). What are the similarities and differences you see in them?
A muscle cell (Fig. 2.6a) is shaped like a spindle, while a nerve 
cell (Fig. 2.6b) is very long and has branches. Similarly, some cells 
are round in shape, while others are long and thin. The number 

of cells also varies in different organisms. Why do cells look so 

different from each other? Does the shape and structure of a cell 

relate to its function?

The unique shape, size, andstructure of cells help them 
carry out their specific functions. Buthow do these cells help in 
performing various functions in the body? Let us find out.
You observed in Activity 2.3 that inner cheek cells are thin 
and flat. They form a protective lining on the inner surface of the 

cheek. Nerve cells also known as 
neurons
 carry messages in our 

body. The elongated shape and branched structure help them 

reach different parts of the body and pass on messages quickly. 

Similarly, plant cells also show variation. In plants, too, cells may 

be rectangular, elongated, oval, or even tube-like. Some plant 

cells form long tubes that help carry water throughout the plant.
You have already studied the digestive system in Grade 7. Different 
parts of the digestive system are made up of different types of cells.  

A group of muscle cells are present in the food pipe. These cells 

contract and relax in a wave-like manner, pushing the food down  

to the stomach. This movement is possible because muscle cells are 

thin, flexible, and spindle-shaped. The stomach also has different  

types of cells for performing different functions. Muscle cells in the 

stomach wall help churn the food. Other cells in the inner lining of 

the stomach produce digestive juices and acid that help break down  

the food. All these cells work together to make digestion possible.
2.2 What Are the Levels of Organisation in 

the Body of a Living Organism?
The body of a living organism is organised in a complex way. Cell 

(Fig.
 
2.7a), is the basic unit of life, just lik
e a brick is the basic unit of wall  
(Fig. 2.3d). A group of similar cells forms a type of 
tissue 
(Fig.
 
2.7b).
 
Different tissues are organised to form an 
organ
 (Fig.
 
2.7c).Sever
al 
organs work together to form an 
organ system
 that performs a  

major function of the body (Fig. 2.7d). All the organ systems together 

make up a complete 
organism
 (Fig. 2.7e)
 
Š
 
like a plant or an animal.
So, the levels of organisations are:
Cell 
 Tissue 
 Organ 
 Organ system 
 Organism
These levels of organisation help us understand how simple 
building blocks like cells come together to form a complex 

living
 
being.
The life of complex living organisms begins with a single cellŠ 
‚egg™. The egg of any organism has an amazing ability to divide 

repeatedly to form a complete living being made up of many cells. 

Such living beings are called 
multicellular
 
organisms
. Animals, 
including humans, and plants are all examples of multicellular 

organisms.

Ever heard of ...
The yolk (the yellow part of an egg) of an 
ostrich egg is a single cell
 
Š
 
the largest 
knowncell 
in the living 
world
 
Š
 
measuring 
about 130 
mm to 170 mm in diameter. The 

egg contains extra non-cellular 
material: a shell for protection and a white liquid that 

nourishes the cell during its continued development.
2.3 What Are Microorganisms?
Some living organisms are made up of just one or very few cells. 

They are so small that they can not be seen with the naked eye. 

These are called 
microorganisms.
 Some microorganisms, like 

bacteria and 
Amoeba
, are made of just one cell (unicellular). Others, 

like some fungi and algae, have many cells (multicellular). They 

are found all around us
 
Š
 
in water, soil, air, and even inside our 
body! But what do their cells look like? Are they lik
e the plant and 
animal cells we just learnt about, or are they different? To observe 

the cells of a microorganism, again, we need to use a microscope 



have also created a low-cost and foldable paper microscope or 

foldscope. Foldscopes may not provide the same level of details 

like high-powered laboratory microscopes. However, these make 

microscopic world accessible to many people.
Let us now take a closer look at the fascinating world of microbes.
Activity 2.4: Let us observe pond water/

stagnant water
 
Take a container andcollect pond or stagnant water in it 

with the help of your teacher or elder(s).
 
Use a dropper and place a drop of pond or stagnant water on 

a microscope or foldscope slide. Put a coverslip and observe 

it under the microscope or foldscope.
 
Observe the tiny organisms found in the pond or stagnant 

water.
Activity 2.5: Let us observe soil suspension
 
Take a beaker and collect some moist soil in it from the 


hands

use a spoon or gloves.

Pour some water into the beaker and stir it with a glass rod. 
 

soil, and is called soil suspension. Keep it aside for some time 

and let the mixture settle.
 
Use a dropper and take a drop of water from the top layer. 

Place the drop on a microscope slide.
 
Cover it gently with a coverslip and observe it under the 

microscope (Fig. 2.8).
You may observe small moving organisms similar to those you saw 

in Activity 2.4. This indicates that even
 soil
 
suspension
 contains a 
variety of tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the unaided eye.

The tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the naked eye are called 

microorganisms (micro means very small; organisms means living 

beings) or 
microbes
.
Activity 2.6: Let us study
A group of students studying in Grade 8 performed Activities 2.4 

and 2.5. They also collected information from the library and 

internet. They recorded the data obtained after observing pond 

water in Table 2.1 and the data obtained after observing soil 



 

any of these categories of organisms.

Did you also observe any of these microorganisms or 
something different? Record in your notebook and discuss in 
your class. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you have identified a variety 

of microorganisms. They are everywhere, and we can only see 

them with a microscope
 
Š
 
adevice 
that magnifies them 100 to 
400 times. Though microorganisms are small in size, they play an 

important role in our lives.
Ever heard of ...
Viruses
 are microscopic and acellular. Viruses 

multiply when they enter a living cell. They may 

infect plants, animals, or bacterial cells and may 

cause  a disease.

2.4 How Are We Connected to Microbes?

Let us have a discussion:
Have you ever seen a lemon, tomato, orange, or any 
other food item rot after being left outside for some 

time? If yes, you may have noticed a powdery or 

cotton-like growth on them (Fig. 2.9). This happens 

because they have been infected by microbes. But 

where did these microbes come from? How did they 

come in contact with the food?
This happens because microorganisms can be found 
everywhere, be it in water, soil, air, or even in some food items.  
You can use a foldscope 
or a microscope to explore 

surfaces of leaves, stems,  

roots, or any other part to 

see them. Like plants and 

animals, microorganisms 

also show great diversity.  

Some of them can even be 

found in extreme climatic 

conditions, such as hot 

water springs and snow 
cold zones as well as at moderate temperatures. You already know 

some of these organisms live inside our bodies, especially in our 

gut! You have studied in the chapter ‚Life Processes in Animals™ in  

Curiosity
, Grade 7 that our intestine has many bacteria that help in  

digestion. Like plants and animals, microorganisms vary in shape,  

size, and structure. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you would have observed 

microorganisms of different shapes
 
Š
 
spherical, rod-shape, or 
irregular.
How 
does the diversity of microorganisms play a role in our 
daily life? How do they help clean the environment?
2.4.1 Key players in cleaning the environment
Let us attempt to understand this by doing an activity.
Activity 2.7: Let us do
 

 
Add some fruit and vegetable peels to the container. 
Thereafter, put a layer of soil on it and leave it aside.
This is because you add many spices 

with salt or sugar to it which act as 

preservatives. High concentration 

of salt or sugar do not allow these 

organisms to grow on them.
But why do 
microorganisms
 
not infect the pickles and 

murabbas?

growing on it

19
 
After 2Œ3 weeks, observe the changes 
that have taken place.
 
Do you observe any difference in the 

contents of the container?
You may find that peels of fruits and 
vegetables have turned into a dark-coloured 

material. This is 
manure
, which is rich in 

nutrients and helps increase the fertility of 

the soil. But how did the peels of fruits and 

vegetables turn into manure?
In Activity 2.6, you saw that soil contains 
various kinds of microorganisms. Some of 

these microorganisms, like fungi and bacteria, 

act on the plant waste and slowly break it down into simpler, 

nutrient-rich manure. You may have seen gardeners in your 

school or in a field near your house collecting dry leaves and 

plant waste and putting them into pits. Do you now understand 

why they do this? It is to make natural manure.
Ancient Indian texts, particularly the Vedas, have references of 

the word ‚
Krimi
™ which means different tiny entities including 

‚
Drishya
™ (visible) and ‚
Adrishya
™ (invisible). Various Vedic texts 


Atharvaveda also refers to ‚
Krimi
™. 
If you look around carefully, you might see decaying plants 
andfallen leaves storedin a container or lying in the garden, 

disappear after some time from the surroundings. This is 

because microorganisms breakdown and turn them into simpler 

substances rich in nutrients. These nutrients go back to the soil 

and help plants grow better. Microorganisms also decompose 

bodies of deadanimals. So, microbes helprecycle the waste and 

return important nutrients to nature. Manure formation occurs 

at optimal temperature and appropriate moisture level.
Isn™t it interesting? By now, you must have understood that 
bacteria and some fungi are types of microorganisms that play 

an important role in our lives. And guess what, these helpful 

bacteria can also decompose animal wastes like dung!
From Activity 2.7, we can also infer that microorganisms not 
only help in plant growth, but also clean our environment by 

breaking down waste.

manure

Now, think what would have happened if microorganisms did 
not exist on Earth?
A step further
Microbes as a source of 
biogas
Many microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, live in an oxygen-
free environment. Some of these bacteria have the ability to 

decompose plant and animal waste present in the environment or 

householdwastewater. During the process, they release a mixture 

of gases containing carbon dioxide, and a high proportion of 

another gas, methane. This gas has been used as a fuel source for 

cooking, heating, generating electricity, and to even run vehicles.
Be a scientist
Dr. Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty (1938Œ2020) was a  

scientist who studied bacteria. In 1971, he developed 

a special bacterium that could break down oil spills,  

helping to clean the environment. His discovery  

received a patent in 1980. 
Patent
 is a copyright 

given to a person so that no one else can copy, use 

or sell his/her invention without permission. His 

work showed how microorganisms could be used 

to solve environmental problems like pollution.  He 

is remembered for his contributions to science and for protecting the 

environment using microbes. What are the other  problems which you 

think can be solved with the help of microorganisms?  
How does the diversity of microorganisms help in our kitchen?

Let us try to understand by performing activities in the kitchen.

21
 
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and keep it in a warm place.
 
Observe both the bowls after 4Œ5 hours.
Did you find any change in the volume, smell, or texture of the 
dough? If not, leave the dough for some more time. After some time,  
you may notice that the dough in bowl A, where yeast was added, has 

risen slightly, become fluffy, and has a different smell compared to 

the dough kneaded without yeast. Why does this happen? What is the 

role of yeast? Why did we add sugar and warm water to the flour?
Yeast is a type of microorganism. It belongs to a group 
of microorganisms, called 
fungi
. Yeast grows well in warm 

conditions. You may recall from chapter ‚Life Process in Animals™ 

in Grade 7 that, like other organisms, yeast also respires and breaks 

down food to release energy for their growth and carry out life 

processes. During this process, carbon dioxide is released, which 

forms bubbles that makes the dough soft and fluffy. Yeast also 

produces a small amount of alcohol during this process, which 

gives the dough a slightly different smell. This special property of 

yeast is used in the process of making breads, cakes, and more! 

In addition to yeast, some bacteria, such as 
Lactobacillus,
 help in 

fermentation of batter for making idliand dosa, and dough for 

making 
bhatura
.
Activity 2.9: Let us prepare
 
Take two small glass bowls
 
Š
 
label them ‚A

Pour lukewarm milk in bowl A, and cold milk in bowl B.
 
Now, add a small spoonful of curd to each bowl and mix well 

using a spoon.
 
Cover both bowls. Keep bowl A in a warm place and bowl B in 

a cool place (like a refrigerator) for a few hours or overnight.
 
Observe the changes in the glass bowls. Write your predictions 

and observations in Table 2.4.

22
You will observe that in bowl 
A, the milk has turned into curd 
after a few hours and has become 

little sour. Whereas in bowl B, the 

milk has not curdled, but it might 

be a little sour. Do you know why 

this happens? The curd contains 

several types of bacteria. One 

of them is 
Lactobacillus
. This 
bacterium feeds on the sugar in 

the milk (lactose), multiplies, and 

ferments the milk to form curd. 

Instead of producing alcohol (like 

yeast), these bacteria produce 

lactic acid, which makes curd 
sour. These bacteria grow well in warm conditions. That is why 

curd is formed in bowl A but not in bowl B.
We can categorise the microorganisms into different 
categories, such as protozoa, fungi, bacteria, some algae, and 

more. Some bacteria, such as 
Rhizobium
, form the swollen 

regions called nodules and live in them as shown in Fig. 2.12. 

Roots of certain legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils have 

root nodules that contain 
Rhizobium
 bacteria. These bacteria 

trap nitrogen from the air and make it useful for the plants. 

This helps plants grow better without chemical fertilisers. 

That
 
iswh
y farmers grow legumes in rotation with other crops. 
This
 
natur
ally increases the nitrogen in the soil and keeps it 
healthy for the next crop.
2.4.3 Amazing microalgae: tiny helpers in water 
Microalgae are microscopic plant-like organisms that live in 
water, soil, air, and even on trees. They make their own food using 

sunlight.  While doing this, they also release oxygen and produce 

more than half of the Earth™s oxygen supply. They are rich in 

nutrients and serve as a food source for many aquatic animals. 

Some, like 
Spirulina
, 
Chlorella
, and Diatoms, are also used by 
humans as health supplements and medicines. Microalgae also 

help in cleaning water and are used to make biofuel.
However, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction are 
threatening microalgal diversity and abundance. It is important  

to conserve these tiny organisms to protect the environment and 

maintain oxygen balance on Earth.

more than 60 per cent of its body weightŠand 

only a small amount of fat and sugar.  
Nowadays, farming of 
Spirulina
 is becoming a feasible livelihood 
opportunity. You can grow 
Spirulina
 easily by following these steps:
1.
 
 
Set a clear glass tank in a bright place away from direct sunlight.

Why Is Cell Considered t
o Be a Basic Unit 
of Life?
The body of all living organisms are made up of tiny building 

blocks called cells. A single cell contains various components 

that help organisms perform various functions. The bodies of all 

plants and animals are made up of many cells. Therefore, they are 

called 
multicellular
 (many-celled) organisms. In multicellular 
organisms, cells carry out specialised functions individually but 

also cooperate with each other to increase the chance of survival.
Some microorganisms, such as bacteria 
and protozoa, are made up of just one cell. 

These are called 
unicellular
 (single-celled) 

organisms. They carry out all the functions 

necessary for their survival in a single cell. 

Other microbes, like algae and fungi, are 

made up of one or more cells. For example, 

yeast is a unicellular fungus while mould is 

a multicellular fungus.

Like animal and plant cells, the cells of microorganisms are 
also surrounded by a cell membrane. Cells of fungi additionally 
have a cell wall, but they do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot 

make their own food through photosynthesis. Bacteria do not 

have a well-defined nucleus and a nuclear membrane. Instead 

they have a nucleoid. Thisfeature distinguishes them from cells 

of yeast, protozoa, algae, fungi, plants, and animals.
We have only looked at a few basic cell structures here. The cell  
has other components about which you will learn in higher classes.

For observing subcellular components, we need microscopes 

with  high ma gn ification.  An electron microscope magnifies the 

cell about 10,00,000 times, where we can see more structures 

present in a cell.
By now, you must have understood that all living beings,  
including microorganisms, are made up of one or more cells.  

Their
 
cells differ in size, shape, and structure. Plant and animal
 
cells also have some differences. Understanding these differences 

helps us learn how these organisms function differently.
In this chapter, we have learnt about the beneficial 
microorganisms. However, there are some microbes that cause 

diseases in plants and animals including humans. We will learn 
about some of the diseases caused by microbes in the next chapter.
Snapshots 
 
 
Microorganisms are small-sized organisms and are not visible to the 
unaided eye.
 
They can live in all kinds of environments, and even in the bodies of 

plants and animals.
 
Theyare either unicellular or multicellular. Bacteria and protozoans 

are unicellular; fungi can be unicellular or multicellular, while plants 

and animals are multicellular.
 
The cell is a basic unit of life.
 
The body of all living organisms is made up of cells. A cell contains 

various components which help the organisms perform their functions 

and survive.
 
 

and contains a nucleus. Plant, fungal, and bacterial cells have an extra 

covering, called a cell wall, around the cell membrane. Bacteria lack a 

 
Cells differ in shape and size. Their shape is related to the function 

performed by them.
 
Bacteria, fungi, and protozoa are different kinds of microorganisms.
 
Viruses are also small in size, but they are different from other 

microorganisms since they reproduce only inside the host organism.

Some microorganisms decompose the plant and animal waste into 
simple substances and clean up the environment.
 
Some microorganisms reside in the root nodules of legumes, such as 

peas, beans, and lentils. They trap nitrogen from the air and increase 

the soil fertility.
 
Yeasts are fungi which are used in the process of making breads, cakes, 

pastries, idlis, dosas, and bhaturas.
 
Lactobacillus 
is used in the curd formation at home and fermentation

3.1 Health: Is It More Than Not Falling Sick?
What do the news clippings on the notice board tell you about 
people™s health in our country? Is being healthy just about not 

having diseases? Health also includes feeling good physically, 

staying positive, and having strong relationships. A healthy person 

takes care of their body, maintains a positive mindset, and enjoys 

social life. Let us now 
explore
 what it truly means to be healthy.
Activity 3.1:  Let us read
A Grade 8 student moved to a new school in another city. With no 

friends in his new environment and busy parents, he felt lonely. To 

cope, he spent more time on his phone and social media, but this made 

him feel worse. He stopped trying to make friends, had headaches, 

lost weight, and could not sleep well. A doctor advised less screen 

time and meeting a counsellor. The school counsellor arranged help 

to support him in making friends and improving his health.
Think 
and 
Reflect
: What was the cause of the boy™s health problems?  
How did his habits and surroundings affect his well-being?
As per the World Health Organization (WHO), health is 
defined as a ‚state of complete physical, mental, and social 

well-being, and not merely the absence of disease™ (Fig. 3.1). A 

healthy person can perform various tasks more efficiently and 

cope well in different and difficult situations. A healthy person 

can adjust well with peer groups and other members of society. 

Let us understand more about health.
Ayurveda teaches us that true health is a balance of body, mind, and 

surroundings.
Following 
dinacharya
 (daily routine) and 
ritucharya
 (seasonal routine) helps maintain this 

balance. Eating fresh, wholesome food suited to 

one™s 
prakriti
 (body constitution) is essential. 
Regular exercise, cleanliness, restful sleep, and 

a calm mind support overall well-being. This 

can also be achieved through practices like yoga, 

meditation, and mindfulness.
3.2 How Can We Stay Healthy?
Staying healthy means eating nutritious food, maintaining 

hygiene, staying in a clean place, exercising regularly, getting

proper sleep, spending time with family and friends, and having 
a positive attitude. What we should do and what should not do to 

keep ourselves healthy?
Activity 3.2:  Let us list
 
List some good habits that your parents, teachers, or elders 
often encourage you to follow. How many of these are already 

a part of your daily routine? Which ones would you like to 

start following? Add to the list below:
 
Keep yourself clean and maintain personal hygiene.
 
Eat a healthy and balanced diet.
 
Exercise regularly.
 
Make time to relax or meditate every day.
 
Now, think about habits that are not good for your health. 

Add more to the list below:
 
Spending too much time on mobile phones or other digital 

screens.
 
Eating fast food and other junk food every day.
 
Sleeping very late or not getting enough sleep.
 
Skipping meals, especially breakfast.
Taking care of our body and mind is important. Healthy habits 

support a healthy body as well as a healthy mind. 
Discuss your findings with your friends and teacher. From 
the activity you participated in and the discussions, you may 

have realised that our health depends on many factors. These 

factors include our lifestyle (how we live) and our environment 
(our surroundings).
3.2.1 Maintain a healthy lifestyle
 
Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and 
whole grains.
 
Avoid processed, fatty, or sugary food and drinks.
 
Stay physically active by playing outdoors, walking, running, 

cycling, or exercising.
 
Limit screen time and spend more time in nature.  
 
Get enough sleep to help your body and mind rest and recover.
 
Practice yoga or simple breathing exercises like pranayama 

regularly.
 
Say ‚NO™ to harmful substances things like tobacco, alcohol, 
and addictive drugs (Fig. 3.2).

3.2.2 Keep the environment clean
Activity 3.3: Let us compare
 
Look at Fig. 3.3a and Fig. 3.3b.  Which playground would you 
like to play in, and why?  
 
Most of us would like to play in the 

playground shown in Fig. 3.3a as it is clean, 

well-maintained, and looks beautiful. The 

playground in Fig. 3.3b is polluted, dirty, 

unhygienic, and full of flies and mosquitoes. 

People living in such areas may fall sick 

more often. 
 
In addition to inculcating good habits and 

adopting a healthy lifestyle, we must keep 

ourselves and our surroundings clean.  
 
Have you ever found it hard to breathe in 

a place with a lot of smoke or dust? That is 

because clean air and water are important 

for our health. In cities, air pollution from 

vehicles and factories can cause problems 

like coughing or asthma. The 
Air Quality 

Index
 (AQI) helps us know how clean the 

air is. A cleaner environment helps us stay 

healthy and feel better.
 
Buthealth is not only about the body.
 

Our feelings and relationships matter too. 

Even if we eat well and live in a clean place, 

we may not feel good if we are lonely or upset. Spending 

time withfriends and family, talking, laughing,and having 

fun help keep our minds healthy too.
3.3 How Do We Know That We Are Unwell?
Our body usually works in a certain way to keep us healthy. 

When we feel unwell, it means something inside us may not 

be working as it should. We may have symptoms, such as pain, 

tiredness, or dizziness, and signs like fever, rash, high blood 

pressure, or swelling that indicate we are unwell. A symptom 

is what we feel (like pain), while a sign is something that can be 

seen or measured (like high body temperature when we have 

fever). These help doctors understand what might be making us 

unwell.

3.4 Diseases: What Are the Causes and Types?
A disease is a condition that affects the normal working of the 
body or mind. It can happen when one or more organs or organ 

systems stop functioning properly. Some diseases are caused by 

germs like bacteria, viruses, fungi, worms, or even by protozoa 

(single-celled organisms). These disease-causing organisms are 

called 
pathogens
. Other diseases may result from poor nutrition 
or an unhealthy lifestyle. Some diseases last for a short time, while 

others can continue for a long time and need regular treatment 

or care. Diseases can be grouped into two major types based on 

their causes and how they spread:
 
Non-communicable 

diseasesŠ
 Some diseases, like 

cancer, diabetes, or asthma, 

are not caused by pathogens 

and do not spread from one 

person to another. They are 

usually linked to lifestyle, diet, 

and/or environment.
 
Communicable diseasesŠ
 

Diseases caused by pathogens 

are called communicable 

diseases. They can spread 

from one person to 

another. Some examples 

of communicable diseases 

are typhoid, dengue, flu, 

chickenpox, and COVID-19. 
In recent years, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like 
diabetes, heart disease, and cancer have become more common 

in India. Thisis happening because of changes in how people 

live
 
Š
 
such as eating more processed food, getting less exercise, 
and living longer lives. Today, most deaths in India are caused 

by NCDs. Understanding the difference between these two types 

helps us know how diseases spread and how to prevent them.
3.4.1 How are communicable diseases caused and spread?
All communicable diseases are caused by pathogens. These 

pathogens can enter our body through the air we breathe or by 

consuming contaminated food or water and more. But how do 

these pathogens spread from one person to another? One common 

way is through air, when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or 

through direct contact like shaking hands, or indirectly by sharing

personal items of an infected person. Some of the communicable 
diseases spread through contaminated drinking water or food. 

Some pathogens are also spread by insects like mosquitoes and 

houseflies
 
Š
 
these insects are called 
vectors 
(Fig. 3.4).
By understanding how diseases spread, we can take simple 
steps to protect ourselves and others. Let us find out how these 

communicable diseases spread and how we can prevent them.
 
Grade 8 students listed some common communicable 

diseases in Table 3.1 during a community campaign and a 

library survey.
 
Check the information listed by referring to books, trusted 

websites, or asking your science teacher. Add any missing details.

By studying the Table 3.1, we can understand how infectious 
diseases spread and how to prevent them. Here are some simple 

but important precautions:
 
Keeping ourselves and our surroundings clean.
 
Practising basic hygiene every day.
 
Washing hands with soap and water to remove pathogens. 
 
Covering our mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing.
 
Wearing a mask in crowded places provides protection.
 
Avoid sharing of personal items like towels 

and handkerchiefs.
 
Keeping our home, food, and water clean.
 
Staying at home and resting when we are unwell helps the 

body recover and minimises spreading the disease to others.
Some infectious diseases are caused by worms that live inside 
our bodies, especially in the digestive system. They feed on nutrients 

and live as 
parasites
 
Š
 
organismsthat 
live in or on another living 
being. These worms usually spread through contaminated food, 

water, soil, or contact with infected people or animals.
3.4.2 How are non-communicable diseases caused? 
You learnt that non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, 

and asthma are linked to lifestyle, diet, and/or environment. 

They are the most common cause of death in India. In Grade 6, 

you also learnt about diseases like scurvy, anaemia, and goitre, 
Are diseases always 

caused by infections?

36
which are caused by a lack of specific nutrients 
in the diet. These are called 
deficiency diseases
 
and are also non-communicable.
Dise
ases such as cancer, diabetes, and asthma may often persist 
for a long time (more than 3 months) and are referred to as 
chronic diseases
. 
Diabetes is a common disease whichis becoming more 
prevalent in adults as well as children. In fact, India now has 
one of the highest numbers of people with diabetes in the world.
 

It often develops due to a combination of hormonal imbalances, 

unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity,  being overweight 

or obese, and other reasons.
Let us learn more about the causes of non-communicable 
diseases and their prevention.

Be a scientist
Dr. Kamal Ranadive (1917Œ2001)  was a pioneering 
biomedical researcher. She studied how hormones 

and certain viruses are linked to cancer, helping 

improve its treatment and prevention. Her work 

also showed how tobacco, diet, and pollution can 

raise the risk of cancer, highlighting the importance 

of a healthy lifestyle.
3.5 How to Prevent and Control Diseases?
You might have heard the phrase ‚Prevention is better than cure.™ 
It is important to protect ourselves from both communicable and 
non-communicable diseases.
Activity 3.6: Let us read
In Bhadrak district, Odisha, a community sanitation campaign 
helped more people build and use toilets. This reduced open 

defecation significantly, and improved child health, with fewer 

cases of diarrhoea and infections.
What do you 
infer 
from this case study? Simple steps like good 
sanitation can greatly reduce the spread of communicable diseases. 

Find about such community campaigns held in your location. Share 

in your class and discuss with your peers about the impact of such 
initiatives.
 
You would have noticed that some people get sick more frequently 
than others, although living in a similar environment. Do you 

know why? The natural ability of our body to fight diseases is 

known as 
immunity
. Our body has a special system called the 

immune system that helps fight against diseases. 
You might have taken some drops or injections in your 
childhood to protect yourself from certain diseases, such as 

polio, measles, tetanus, and hepatitis. These are 
vaccines
 that 
help prevent serious infections caused by viruses and bacteria. 
A vaccine helps our body fight certain diseases by training 
the immune system to recognise and attack harmful germs.

to make a harmless part of the germ, which our immune system 
then learns to fight.
For example, a tetanus shot, often given after an injury 
protects against infection by the tetanus-causing bacteria.
 

It contains an inactivated bacterial toxin that helps the immune 

system develop protection without causing the disease.
Do you know when the first vaccine was discovered?
Edward Jenner and the smallpox vaccine 
Smallpox was a deadly disease that caused blisters and killed 

millions. A milder disease called cowpox, seen in cows, could also 

infect humans. In the late 1700s, English doctor Edward Jenner 

discovered that people who had cowpox did not get smallpox. 

This led to the invention of the first vaccine and helped protect 
people from smallpox.
Long before modern vaccines, India had a traditionalmethod called 

variolation to protect against smallpox. It involved using material 

from a smallpox sore to scratch the skin and create a mild infection 

and build immunity. People who performed this practice were known 

as 
teekedaars
.
Think like a scientist
Observations

Jenner observed that milkmaids who had 

cowpox did not catch smallpox, likely because 

the two viruses are related.
Results
He found that people who were infected 

with cowpox sap were now resistant to 

smallpox.

 

Application

Mass vaccination eventually helped 

eradicate smallpox worldwide.
Experimentation

He tested this by injecting cowpox sap into a 

boy, who later showed no illness when exposed 

to smallpox.

India™s Role in Vaccine Production

India is one of the world™s largest vaccine 

producers. It manufactures vaccines on a 

massive scale and supplies them to many 

countries. Indian vaccine companies 

played a key role duringthe COVID-19 

pandemic and continue to support global 

health efforts. 
Be a scientist
Dr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan was a well-known Indian 

doctor and scientist. As Secretary of the Department 

of Biotechnology, he helped promote science and 

innovation in India. He played a key role in developing 

the Rotavirus vaccine, which protects children from 

diarrhoea. He believed in using research to create 

affordable healthcare and made a big difference in 

India™s health and biotechnology sectors.
3.5.1 Treatment of diseases
If our immune system fails to protect us against an infectious 

disease, we fall ill and need to visit a doctor. The doctor may 

give us medicines called 
antibiotics
, whichkill the bacteria that 
might have caused the disease. Antibiotics work only against 

bacterial infections because they target parts of bacterial cells 

that are different from human or other animal cells. They do not 

work against viruses or diseases caused by protozoa.

Think like a scientist
Discovery of the first antibiotic, Penicillin
Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, 

a bacteriologist from London. Whilestudying harmful 

bacteria, he noticed that a mould on a discarded petri 

dish stopped the bacteria from growing. He realized 

the mould released a substance that killed the bacteria. 

This chance discovery led to the discovery of penicillin, 

the first  antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.
Though antibiotics are effective in protecting us against 
bacterial infections and have saved millions of lives since their 

discovery, their indiscriminate use has led to a decline in their 

effectiveness (Fig. 3.5a). Nowadays, there are news headlines 

about 
antibiotic resistance
, a phenomenon where bacteria that 
were earlier killed by a given antibiotic are found to survive 

and multiplydespite treatment withthat antibiotic. This makes

It was the day of the science exhibition, andthe school was 
buzzing with energy. Mohini and Aakarsh, along with their 

friends, went from one exhibit to another, eagerly exploring 

different models, asking questions and taking notes. One simple 

model really fascinated them. It was a working model of a lifting 

electromagnet which was displayed by their senior, Sumana. 

In
 
it, 
instead of a hook like a typical crane, there was an iron 
nail wrapped with a wire, which was connected to a battery. 

When
 
Suma
na closed the circuit, the nail picked up iron paper 
clips like a magnet. When she opened the circuit, the clips fell 

off. Mohini and Aakarsh, were surprised. They remembered 

learning earlier (in the chapter ‚Exploring Magnets™, 
Curiosity,
 

Grade
 
6) that magnetic materials were attr
acted by magnet and 
that iron was a magnetic material. But in Sumana™s model, there 

was no magnet, only an electric circuit. They were so excited that 

they wanted to try it out themselves.

Does an Electric Current Hav
e a Magnetic 
Effect? 
 
Collect a magnetic compass, an electric cell, a cell holder, 

two drawing pins, a safety pin, two nails, two pieces of 

connecting wires (one longer andone shorter), andtwo 

small pieces of cardboard. 
 
Using two drawing pins, a safety pin, and a cardboard 

piece, make a switch (as you made it earlier in the 

chapter ‚Electricity: Circuits and their Components™ in 

Curiosity, 
Grade 7).
 
Place the cell in the cell holder. 
 
Fix two nails to a piece of cardboard as shown in 

Fig.
 
4.1a. Fixthe 
middle portion of the longer wire 
stretched between the nails, such that it is slightly above 

the surface of the cardboard. Attach one end of that 

wire to the cell holder and another end to the switch.
 
Connect the second wire between the cell holder and 

the switch.
 
Place the magnetic compass beneath the wire between 

the two nails (Fig. 4.1a).

While watching the compass needle, move the switch to 
‚ON™ position to allow electric current to flow through the wire 
(Fig.
 
4.1b). What do you 
observe
? 
 
Now again while watching the compass needle, move the 

switch to ‚OFF™ position. What do you observe this time? 
 
Move the switch between ‚ON™ and ‚OFF™ positions a few more 

times. Carefully observe howthe compass needle behaves 

the each time.
You may have 
noticed
 that when the current flows, the compass 
needle gets deflected from its original direction. When the current 

stops, the needle returns to its original direction.  
As we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‚Exploring Magnets™ 
in 
Curiosity, 
Grade 6), the compass needle is a tiny magnet which 
deflects when a magnet is brought near it and this magnetic effect 

can act through any non-magnetic materials kept in between. 

But why does the compass needle deflect when the current 

flows through the wire? The deflection indicates that the current 

carrying wire has a magnetic effect on the compass needle. 

When the current stops, this magnetic effect disappears and 

the compass needle returns to its original direction. Theregion 

around a magnet or a current carrying wire where its magnetic 

effect can be felt, such as by the deflection of a compass needle, 

is said to have a 
magnetic field
.
When electric current flows 
through a conductor (like a wire), it 

produces a magnetic field around it. 

This phenomenon is known as the 

magnetic effect of electric current
. 

The magnetic field disappears when 

the current stops flowing.
You have just now made the same discovery which 

was made by the scientist Hans Christian Oersted 

(1777Œ1851) in 1820, that is, the discovery that 

electricity and magnetism are linked. He was a 

professor at a university in Denmark. It is said that 

once while giving a demonstration, he noticed that 

whenever an electrical circuit was closed or 

opened, the needle of a magnetic compass, lying 
nearby, deflected. He investigated this and when he was certain that 

an electric current indeed produced a magnetic field, he published 

his findings. This led to other scientists repeating his experiment to 

check if they got the same results, and further investigating the 

connection between electricity and magnetism. 
We have learnt about magnets 

and electric current in earlier 

grades. I used to think that there 

was no link between the two. But 

now we found that electricity 

and magnetic effect are linked!

The magnetic effect of electric current 
has many practical applications, such as 

in devices like electromagnets, electric 

bells, motors, fans, loudspeakers, 

and
 
more. 


 
Take around 50 cm long length of a flexible 

insulated wire, an iron nail, an electric cell, and 

few iron paper clips.
 
Tightly wrap the wire around the nail in the form 

of a coil, as shown in Fig. 4.2, and secure it with 

an adhesive tape.
 
Connect the ends of the wire to the cell. Take care 

to not connect the wires to the cell for more than 

a few seconds; otherwise, the cell may weaken 

quickly. 
 
Bring the nail close to the iron paper clips and 

lift up. Do the clips hang to the ends of the nail?
 
Disconnect the wire from the cell to stop the 

flow of electric current in the wire. Do the clips 

fall
 
down?
When electric 
current flows through the coil, the clips cling 
to it. But when the current is stopped, the clips no longer cling 

to it. Let us now try to 
investigate
 these observations in detail 

through Activity 4.3.

 
Take around 100 cm long flexible insulated wire, a piece 

of chart paper, an iron nail, an electric cell, two magnetic 

compasses, and few iron/steel paper clips.
 
Roll a piece of chart paper to make a cylinder of diameter 

roughly equal to the width of a pencil. Secure it with an 

adhesive tape.
 
Tightlywind around 50 turns of the insulated wire on the 

cylinder to form a cylindrical coil as shown in Fig.
 
4.3a. 
Secure the wire with an adhesive tape.

Place the compasses near the two ends of the 
cylindrical coil (Fig. 4.3b).
 
Connect the two ends of the coil with the 

terminals of the cell as shown in Fig. 4.3c and 

observe the magnetic compasses. Do you find 

any deflection in the needles of the compasses?
 
Disconnect the wire from the cell. Do the needles 

of the compasses come back to their original 

positions?
 
Insert an iron nail in the paper cylinder (Fig.
 
4.3d) 
and repeat the steps. Is there any difference in 

the deflection of the compass needles?
 
Place some iron paper clips near the two ends 

of the nail. Are the clips attracted to the ends of 

the nail?
It is observed that when current is passed through 
the cylindrical coil, it behaves like a magnet and 

deflects the needle of a magnetic compass. When an  

iron nail is inserted in the core of the coil, then the 

coil becomes a stronger magnet and the deflection of 

the magnetic compass needle is much more. It also 

attracts iron clips (Fig. 4.3e). When the current is 

stopped, the cylindrical coil loses its magnetic effect. 
A current carrying coil that behaves as a magnet is 
called an 
electromagnet
. For practical applications, 

most electromagnets have an iron core to make them 

stronger.
Does electromagnet also have 

two poles like a bar magnet?
 
Take the electromagne t made in Activity 4.3 and a magnetic 

compass. Label the two ends of the coil as A and B.
 
Place the magnetic compass near the end A of the coil as 

shown in Fig. 4.4a.
 
Connect the coil to the cell and observe the compass. Note down 

which pole of the magnetic compass is attracted to end A.

As we have learnt earlier, when two magnets are brought close 
to each other, their unlike poles (NorthŒSouth) attract each other. 
So, if north pole of the magnetic compass is attracted towards 

end A of the electromagnet, then end A is south pole.
 
Repeat this procedure to find the polarity of end B as well 

(Fig. 4.4b). Did you find that the polarity of end B is opposite 

to the polarity of end A?
We learnt in grade 6 that a magnet has two poles. Just like a 
magnet, an electromagnet also has two poles
 
Š
 
North andSouth.
Repeat Activity 4.3 with
 
Š (i) 2 and 4 cells with the same coil, (ii) 2 cells 
but 
different number of turns of the coil. What do you observe?
A single cell provides only a small amount of current, so the magnetic 


can only attract a few clips. A battery with more cells gives a larger current 





more clips. The increase in number of turns of the coil also makes the coil a 

stronger magnet! 
Also, repeat Activity 4.4 by changing the direction of the current. 
 
So, the strength of an electromagnet can be changed by changing the amount  

 

or both. Also, its poles can be reversed by changing the direction of the current.
Do you remember learning earlier (in the chapter ‚Exploring 

Magnets™ in 
Curiosity, 
Grade 6) that a freely suspended magnet rests 
along the northŒsouth direction because our Earth itself behaves 

like a giant magnet? But why does Earth behave like a magnet? Deep 

inside the Earth, the movement of liquid iron in the core creates 

electric currents, which generate a magnetic field. Many migratory 

birds, fish, and animals use this field to navigate across continents 

and oceans. The Earth™s magnetic field also acts as a shield, blocking 

harmful particles from space, and helps protect life on Earth.

Lifting electromagnets are strong 
electromagnets, that may be hung to the 

cranes. Thecrane operator can control the 
magnet by switching the current 
ON
 and 
OFF
. When the current 

is turned 
ON
, the electromagnet lifts the iron/steel objects; when 

the current is switched 
OFF
, magnetic field disappears, andthe 
objects are released. Lifting electromagnets are widely used in 

factories and scrap yards, to move, lift, and sort heavy metal 

items efficiently.
We have learnt that when electric current flows through a 

conductor (like a wire), it produces a magnetic field around it. In 

the higher grades, you will learn even more about this wonderful 

link between electricity and magnetism, including the exciting idea 

that just as electricity can produce magnetism, a moving magnet 

can also lead to an electric current. This deep connection between 

electricity and magnetism is vital to our daily lives, as it forms the 

basis of many devices, from electric motors to power generators.
4.2 Does a Current Carrying Wire Get Hot?
In this activity, we will use a special kind 

of wire, called a nichrome wire.
 
Take a cardboard piece of about 10
 
cm 
length and 10 cm width, two nails, 
a nichrome wire of thickness about 

0.3
 
mm 
(26Œ28 gauge) and length of 
10 cm, an electric cell, a cell holder, a 

switch, and connecting wires. 
 
Mount the nails on the cardboard about 5 cm apart.
 
Tie the nichrome wire between these nails and make the 

connections as shown in Fig. 4.5 with the switch in OFF 

position.
 
Touch the nichrome wire. What do you feel?
 
Move the switch to ON position for about 30 s and then 

move it back to OFF. Touch the nichrome wire momentarily 
 
Whiledoing the activity for 

electromagnet, did you also 

notice that the wire ends 

got warm? Why would that 

happen?
Are electromagnets also 

used in real life, for 

lifting objects?

(Do
 
not hold the nichrome wire). 
What difference do you feel?
 
Repeat the last two steps to 
confirm
 the observation.
You may have observed that nichrome wire 
feels warm when current is passed through it.  

This happens because, when electric current 

flows through any conductor, it faces some 

opposition or resistance to its flow. Different 

conductors offer different levels of resistance 

to the flow of current. A nichrome wire, for 

example, offers higher resistance compared to 

a copper wire of the same size and length. This 

resistance causes some of the electrical energy to 

be converte d into heat energy. When an electric 

current passes through a conductor, it gets 

heated. This warming is known as the 
heating 

effect of electric current
.
This activity should be carried out strictly under the supervision 

of a teacher.
Repeat Activity 4.5 with a battery of 2 cells. Whatdo you notice? 
For the same duration, does the wire heat up more with one cell or 

two
 
cells?
The amount of heat gener
ated is more in the experiment with 
2 cells. Thisis due to the fact that the heat generated depends on 

the magnitude of the electric current. The heat generated in a wire 

depends on the material, thickness, and length of the wire, and the 


In Grade 7, we have learnt that an incandescent lamp glows 
because its filament is heated by an electric current. Many 

household appliances, such as electric room heaters, stoves, 

irons, immersion rods, water 

heaters, kettles, and hair dryers 

(Fig. 4.6) work on the same principle 

of the heating effect of electric 

current. All
 
these devices contain a 
rod 
or a coil of wire, called a heating 
element. In some appliances where 

this element is visible, it can be seen glowing red
 
hot.
Fig. 4.5: Heating effect in a wire
Oh, now I understand why 

the incandescent torch lamp 

sometimes used to get warm 

when we did the activity 

of making it glow using an 

electric cell.
Do not touch the wire for an extended 

period to avoid any injuries.

The heating effect of electric 
current is useful in many everyday 
appliances. But sometimes, it can 

cause problems, like energy loss 

in wires during transmission. 

Overheating in appliances may cause 

damage to plugs and sockets where 

plastic parts may melt, or even lead 

to fires. In household circuits, there 

are safety devices placed in the 

circuit to minimise such incidents.

Beyond household use, heating effect of electric current has 

several industrial applications. One notable example is in 

steel manufacturing industries, where a specially designed 
 
high-temperature furnace (an enclosed space built to generate
 
heat) 
uses electric current to 
produce heat. This is used to melt and 
recycle  scrap steel, converting it into usable steel.

To prevent unnecessary heating 

in household switchboards, it is 

important to use appropriate 

wires, plugs, and sockets that are 

rated for the specified electric 

current of the connections.

Yes, but have you ever wondered 
what is inside these cells and 

batteries that produces electricity?
The portable sources of electricity, 

such as cells and batteries, are so 

fascinating. Using these, we could 

light up a small lamp, make a magnet, 

and heat up a wire.
4.3 How Does a Batter y Generate Electricity?
Let us start with one of the earliest types of electric cells ever made.
4.3.1 Voltaic cell
A Voltaic cell, also known as Galvanic cell, is 

shown in Fig. 4.7. It contains two metal plates 

made of different materials and a liquid called 

an electrolyte, placed in a glass or plastic 

container. The plates, called electrodes, are 

partly dippedin the electrolyte, which is usually 

a weak acid or salt solution. A chemical reaction 

between the plates and the electrolyte produces 

electricity. When the circuit is connected, 

electric current flows from the positive terminal 

through the circuit to the negative terminal. 

Over time, the chemicals get used up, and the 

cell stops working. It is then called ‚dead™ and 

cannot supply any more electricity. 

The Voltaic or Galvanic cells get their names from two Italian 

scientists, Alessandro Volta and LuigiGalvani. In the late 1700s, 

Galvani noticed that a dead frog™s leg kicked when touched with 

two different metals
 
Š
 
copper andiron. It was 
already known by 
then that electricity could stimulate muscular motion and Galvani 

thought the electricity came from the frog itself. But Volta hada 

different idea. He believed the electricity came from the metals, and 

not the frog. To test this, he used saltwater-soaked paper instead of 

the frog™s leg and still got an electric current. This showed that it 

was the combination of metals and liquid that generated electric 

current
 
Š
 
leading to the invention of the first battery!

Take five or six juicy lemons, copper wires/
strips (1Œ2 mm thick) and iron nails. Also take 

one LED and some connecting wires.
 
Insert the copper wire and the iron nail in one 

of the lemons keeping them apart by a small 

distance as shown in Fig. 4.8a. 
 
Repeat the above step for all the remaining lemons.
 
Join the copper wires and nails as shown in 

Fig.
 
4.8b.
 
Connect the LED between the copper wire of the 

first lemon and the iron nail of the last lemon, using 

connecting wires. What do you observe? Does the 

LED glow?
 
If the LED does not glow, 

reverse its connections. 

Does the LED glow now? 

[Remember that we have 

learnt earlier that current 

can pass through the LED 

only when the positive 

terminal (longer wire) of 

the LED is connecte d to 

the positive terminal of 

the battery, and negative 

terminal (shorter wire) of 
the LED is connected to the negative terminal of the battery].
A glowing LED indicates that your cell is working. In this cell, 
the metal electrodes are the copper wires and the iron nails. 

The
 
electrol
yte is the lemon juice, which helps conduct electricity. 
You may also use salt solutions instead of lemon juice.
Some common metal pairs for Voltaic cells are zinc/copper, zinc/

silver, aluminium/copper, iron/copper, magnesium/copper, and 

lead/copper. Some metals
 
Š
 
like copper
 
Š
 
act as positive electrodes, 
yet some other metals
 
Š
 
like zinc
 
Š
 
act as negative electrodes. This 
is 
due to their chemical properties. We will learn more about this 
in the higher grades.
Can we also make 

our own Voltaic 

cell using easily 

available materials?

Voltaic cells were an important discovery, but they are not 
convenient for everyday use. Instead, dry cells are one of the most 

widely used electric cells today. They are called 

‚dry™ because the electrolyte is not a liquid but 

a thick moist paste. The structure of a dry cell is 

shown in Fig. 4.9. It consists of a zinc container 

which acts as a negative terminal and a carbon 

rod at the centre covered with metal cap that 

acts as the positive terminal. The carbon rod is 

surrounded by the paste-like electrolyte.
The dry cell is a single use cell, meaning 
once it is used up, it has to be disposed of. 

For
 
sever
al applications, rechargeable batteries 
are increasingly being used now.

Rechargeable batteries can be recharged and reused multiple 

times. This prevents wastage and saves money over time as well.

in watches and phones to batteries used in 

laptops and tablet to bigger batteries that run 

inverters or drive electric vehicles (Fig. 4.10).

last forever. After being charged and used 

many times, they slowly wear out.

Today, the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is the most common type of 
rechargeable battery, found in almost all devices that use batteries. 

These batteries rely on special metals like lithium and cobalt, which 

are mined and processe d in limited parts of the world. Because 

of this, countries are now racing to secure supplies, recycle old 

batteries, and develop new technologies.
Scientists are also working on the next big leap: solid-state 
batteries, which replace the liquid or paste-like electrolytes with 

solid materials. These future batteries would be much safer, charge 

faster and last longer. Improved rechargeable batteries are very 

important as the world moves to developing environmentally 

friendly sources of electrical power.

Even when a battery stops working, it is not completely ‚dead™. 

It could still contain materials like acids, and metals like lead, 

cadmium, nickel, or lithium, which may cause fires, or be harmful 

for the environment if the battery is thrown in regular garbage. 

Further, many materials used in these batteries are valuable and 

could be recycled and reused. These days, there are many places 

with special ‚e-waste™ recycling facilities, where used batteries can 

be disposed of. If you are not sure, ask your teacher. Recycling 

batteries is good for the planet and the people.

It was a windy day. Sonali and Ragini were excited to go 
cycling. Their summer vacation had just begun, and they wanted 
to 
explore
 the beautiful landscapes around their village. After 
pumping air into their bicycle tyres, they set off. As they rode 

through the village, the wind rushed past them. ﬁOh no! The 

wind is pushing me hard!ﬂ said Ragini. Smiling, Sonali replied,
 

ﬁWe are riding against the wind. We must push our pedals harder 

to move faster.ﬂ
Their ride took them upa long path to a hilltop. Some parts 
of the road were rough where they found it hard to pedal, while 

other parts were smoother. When they reached the top and were 

enjoying the view, they heard thunder and saw flashes of lightning 

at a distance. Even thoughit looked beautiful, they decidedto 

headback immediately. On the way back, while passing a herd of 

sheep, they pressed their bicycle bells and turned the handles to 

change direction.
As they were coming down the slope of the hill, they realised 
that their bicycles were moving down at a great speed even 

though they were not pedalling!Sonali yelled,ﬁIt™s thrilling! It 

seems something is pulling us downhill, what could it be?ﬂ
5.1 What Is a Force?
Let us try to experience the push and the pull.

Take a large cardboard box. 
 
Try moving the box in as many different ways as you can 

think

Did 
you move the box in any other way than shown in Fig.

In all the ways that you might have used to move the box, you 

had to apply
 a push or pull to the box. Generally, the push or pull 
applied on an object is called force in science.

without even realising it. Let us recall some of these experiences 

and

 them.

Think
 of situations where a force (push or pull) is applied 

and list them in Table 5.1.

What do you 
conclude
 from these examples? Does a force 
cause a moving object to stop? Can it change speed, or direction 

of motion, or change the shape of an object?

In everyday life, we come across many situations where a force 
is applied, for example, opening a drawer, stretching a rubber 
band, a fielder stopping a ball, kicking a football, applying brakes 

on a moving bicycle, rolling a chapati, or turning the steering 

handle of an autorickshaw. What effect can the application of 

force have on objects?
The force applied on an object may
 
make an object move from rest.
 
change the speed of an object if it is moving.
 
change the direction of motion of an object.
 
bring about a change in the shape of an object.
 
cause some or all of these effects.
5.3 
 
Are Forces an Interaction Between Two 
or Mor
e Objects?
When you push a table, your hand is one object applying force 

on another object
 
Š
 
thetable. 
Here, we say that your hand and 
the table are two objects interacting with each other. 
Think of all the actions listed in Table 5.1. How many objects 
are involved in each of the actions? Do you 
notice
 that forces 

result only when two objects are interacting in some way or 

the other? From these examples, we can 
infer
 that at least two 

objects must interact for a force to come into play.
A 
force
 is a push or pull on an object resulting from the 
object™s interaction with another object. The 
SI unit of force is
 
newton
 (written with a small ‚n™) and its 
symbol is N
.
Suppose an object is at rest. Does it mean that no force is acting 

on this object? It means that the forces acting on the object are 

balancing one another. You will learn about balanced forces in 

higher grades.
Does this mean that 

whenever there is a change 

in speed or direction, or 

change in shape, a force is 

acting on the object?
Yes, none of these take 

place without the action 

of force.

Fig. 5.3: Use of muscular force by living beings
When you pushed the table with your hand, did you feel a force 
on your hand too? The moment you stopped pushing, the force on 

your hand disappeared. Whenever two objects interact, each object 

experiences a force from the other. As soon as the interaction 

ceases, the two objects no longer experience the force. 
5.4 What Are the Different Types of Forces?
5.4.1 Contact forces
In many situations, we findthat to apply a force on an object, 

physical contact is necessary between our body and the object. 

This contact can be direct, such as using our hands or other body 

parts, or indirect, such as using a stick or rope. Forces of this 

type whichact only when there is physical contact between the 

objects are called 
contact forces
.
Muscular force
An example of contact force is muscular force. When we perform 

any physical activity, such as walking, running, lifting, pushing, 

jumping, or stretching, the force is caused by the action of muscles 

in our body. The force resulting due to the action of muscles is 

known as muscular force. 
Muscular force 
occurs when muscles 

contract and elongate while doing any activity. 
Animals, birds, fish, and insects use muscular forces for 
movement and survival.

67
Humans used the muscular force of some animals to carry 
out many tasks for a long time.
Fig. 5.4: Use of muscular force of animals to assist with human tasks

Muscular force plays an important role in many functions inside 
our body too. This force helps us chew food and push it through 

the alimentary canal during the process of digestion. The expansion 

and contraction of our heart muscles allows the blood to circulate 

in our body
 
Š
 
a process essential for survival.
Friction
A ball rolling on a flat ground stops on its own 

after some time. If we stop pedalling our bicycle 

on a flat road, it slows down and comes to a stop. 

If the road is rough, it stops sooner than on a smoother road. 

You
 
must 
have come across many such experiences. What causes 
the change in the speed of objects in such situations? We have 

learnt earlier that a force is essential to change the speed of an 

object. However, in all these situations no force appears to be 

acting on the objects, yet their speed gradually decreases and 

they come to a stop after some time. Is it possible that some force 

is indeed acting on them? Which force is that?
Activity 5.3: Let us investigate
 
Take an object with a flat base (such as an empty lunch box/ 

geometry box/ a notebook) and place it on a table or floor.
 
Gently push it and 
observe
. Does it stop after travelling some 

distance? Is there a force acting on it which brings it to rest?
 
Now repeat by pushing the object in the opposite direction. 

Does it stop again after travelling some distance?
Is there any other 

contact force?

68
On pushing, the object stops after sliding a certain 
distance. This must be due to a force acting between the 
surfaces of the sliding object and the table or floor which 

are in contact. This force must be acting on the object in a 

direction opposite to its direction of motion. This force is 

what brings the object to a stop. 
The force that comes into play when an object moves 
or tries to move over another surface is called the 
force 
of friction
 or simply 
friction
. Friction always acts in a 
direction opposite to the direction in which the object is 

moving or trying to move. The force of friction is a contact 
force since it arises due to two surfaces in contact.
Friction arises due to the irregularities in the two surfaces in 
contact. Even surfaces which appear smooth, have a large number 

of minute irregularities (Fig. 5.6). When placed in contact, the 

irregularities of two surfaces lock into each other and oppose 

any effort to move one surface over the other.
Fig. 5.6: Friction between two surfaces due to irregularities
Fig. 5.5: Friction acts between 
two surfaces and opposes the 
motion of the object.
Activity 5.4: Let us explore
 
Try Activity 5.3 again, but this time place the same object on 

different surfaces, such as glass, cloth, wood, ceramic tile, 

and sand. 
 
Does the object stop after travelling the same distance as in 

Activity 5.3?
 
Does the object stop at the same distance on all surfaces?
For different surfaces, the object stops after moving different 
distances so we can say that the force of friction depends upon 

the nature of the surfaces in contact. Friction is greater on rough 

surfaces .
Does the force or friction act only if the objects are moving on solid 

surfaces? What about objects moving through liquids and gases? Air, 

water, and other liquids also exert force of friction on the objects 

moving through them. Hence the objects, such as aeroplanes, ships, 

boats, or high-speed trains are designed with specific shapes to 

reduce the force of friction due to the air or water around them.
Does this mean that

the force of friction

will be greater if the

surfaces are rough?

5.4.2 Non-contact forces
There are forces whose effect can be experienced even if the 
objects are not in contact. These forces are called 
non-contact 

forces
. Let us learn about non-contact forces.
Magnetic force
Do you remember learning about magnets in the chapter 

‚Exploring Magnets™ in 
Curiosity, 
Grade 6? We learnt that a 
magnet attracts objects made of magnetic materials. When two 

magnets are brought close to each other, like poles (NorthŒNorth, 
 
SouthŒSouth) repel each other while unlike poles (NorthŒSouth) 

attract each other. In an earlier chapter of this book, we also learnt 

about electromagnets which behave like magnets. Attraction 

andrepulsionbetween objects are also a form of push andpull, 

that is, a force. Can you recall that a magnet could exert force on 

another magnet or a magnetic material withoutbeing in contact 

with it?
Activity 5.5: Let us test
 
Take two ring magnets and a wooden stick.
 
While holding the stick in a vertical position over a wooden 

table, insert one ring magnet onto the stick (Fig. 5.7).
 
Now insert the second ring magnet above it such that the like 

poles of the two magnets face each other. Does the second 

magnet stay floating above the first magnet?
 
Try pushing the secondmagnet downgently. Do you feel a 

force on it?
 
Now, reverse the poles of both the magnets. Does the second 

magnet still remain floating?
We find that a magnet can exert force on another magnet 
without being in contact with it.
The force exerted by a magnet on another magnet or a 
magnetic material is called 
magnetic force
. Since a magnet can 

exert a force from a distance without being in contact it is called 

a non-contact force.
Are there more such forces which act from a distance?
Fig. 5.7: Force between 
two ring magnets
Is it essential for an object 

applying force on another object 

to always be in contact with it?

Electrostatic force
Activity 5.6: Let us experiment
 
Take a plastic scale or a plastic straw, a piece of 
polythene, and small pieces of paper.
 
Rub plastic scale/straw vigorously with polythene.
 
Do not touch the rubbed part with your hand or 

any metal object.
 
Now, bring it close to the small pieces of paper placed 

on a table, taking care not to touch the paper pieces 

(Fig. 5.8). Do you notice something surprising?
The paper pieces get pulled towards the plastic scale/straw 
and stick to it when it is brought close to paper pieces. Why does 

this happen?
When two objects of certain materials are rubbed together, 
electrical charges build up on their surfaces. These charges are 

called 
static charges
 as they do not move by themselves. The 
object that acquires static charges is said to be a 
charged object
. 

A charged object attracts, that is, exerts a force on uncharged 

objects made of certain materials, such as small pieces of paper. 

This force comes into play even when the bodies are not in contact.
Let us do another activity with objects made of different 
materials.
Activity 5.7: Let us experiment
 
Take two balloons, a length of thread, and a woollen 

cloth.
 
Inflate two balloons and hang them in such a way that 

they do not touch each other as shown in Fig. 5.9a. 
 
Rub both balloons with the woollen cloth and release 

them.Be careful not to touch the rubbed balloons 

with your fingers. What do you observe?
We observe that the balloons move away from each 
other as if they are repelling each other (Fig. 5.9b).
 
Now bring the woollen cloth used for rubbing 

the balloons close to one of the rubbed balloons.
 

What happens?
They move towards each other as if they are attracting 
each other. What do we infer from these observations?

71
We found that the two similarly charged 
balloons repel each other whereas a charged 
balloon and the woollen cloth (with whichthe 

balloon was rubbed) attract each other. Does 

this 
indicate
 that the charge on the balloon is of a different kind 
from the charge on the woollen cloth?  
Since the balloons were charged in the same way, we can say 
that they have acquired similar charges. As the similarly charged 

balloons repelled each other, we can infer that similar (like) 

charges repel each other. Both the rubbing object and the rubbed 

object get charged but they acquire opposite kindof charges. 

Their attraction shows that opposite kind (unlike) of charges 

attract each other. Thetwo kindsof static charges are saidto be 

‚positive™ and ‚negative™.
The force exerted by a charged body on another charged 
body or an uncharged body is called 
electrostatic force
. It is a 
non-contact force.
Does it mean that 

there are two kinds of 

electrical charges?
Gravitational force
Activity 5.8: Let us observe
 
Take a ball and throw it vertically upwards. Does it come 

down?
 
Now throw it again, but this time harder. Does it still fall 

back down to the ground?
Think about different situations around you where any object 
thrown up in any direction, finally falls or comes back to the 

ground or floor.
Fig. 5.10: Some objects falling towards the Earth
When the charges move, they constitute an electric current in an 

electrical circuit. It is the same current which makes a lamp glow 

or generates a heating effect or a magnetic effect.

72
Since all the objects fall towards the Earth, it means the Earth 
attracts (pulls) them. The force with which the Earth attracts objects 
towards itself is called the 
gravitational force
. The gravitational 

force exerted by the Earth is also called 
force of gravity
 or
 
simply 
gravity
. 
Since the gravitational force 
acts without contact with the object  

it attracts, it is a non-contact force.  

Gravitational force is always an  

attractive force, unlike magnetic 

force or electrostatic force, which 

can either be attractive or repulsive.
You might have noticed that 
when an object is dropped from a 

height, it takes a straight vertical 

path downwards before touching 

the ground (Fig.
 
5.11a). When
 
an object is thrown vertically 

upwards, the object moves up 

straight, slows down, stops 

momentarily at the top, and then 

takes a straight vertical path 

downwards (Fig.
 
5.11b).
While 
going up, the speed 
of the object goes on decreasing till the object comes to a stop, 

its direction of motion changes and while coming down the 
speed goes on increasing. We say that the object 

undergoes a 
vertical motion 
when it moves in 

a vertical direction under the influence of the 

gravitational force.
5.5 Weight and Its Measurement 
The force with which the Earth pulls an object towards itself is 

called the 
weight
 of the object. The weight measures how strongly 

an object is pulledby the Earth. Since the weight is a force, it is 

measured in the same unit as that of force. Therefore, 
SI unit of 

weight
 is also 
newton (N)
.
Is there any force 

which acts on them? 

What exerts this force?
Why do all the 

objects fall towards 

the Earth?
Does the Earth 

pull every object 

with equal force?

73
Let us now try to find out if the Earth pulls every object with 
equal force.
Activity 5.9: Let us explore
 
Take a spring and a few objects of different masses, 
such as a pencil box, a tiffin box, and a small stone.
 
Hang one end of the spring from a nail. From the other 

end, hang an object and observe the spring. Does the 

spring stretch? 
 
Now hang the other objects, one by one and notice the 

stretch in the spring each time. Is the stretch caused by 

each object the same?
When an object is hung from a spring, the spring 
stretches due to the force applied on the object by the Earth. 

We find that the stretch caused in the spring is different 

for different objects. This indicates that the Earth pulls 

different objects with different forces, that is, the weight 

of different objects is different. Can we use the spring to 

measure the weight of an object?
A spring balance is a simple device used to measure weight (force).
 
It consists of a spring fixed at one end, with a hook attached at  

the other end. When we hang an object from the hook, the spring 

stretches, and the amount of stretching gives the weight of the object.  

There is a scale on the balance which is marked to show the weight 

(force) in newton. Usually, there is also another scale to show the 

corresponding values of mass in gram (g). These values have been  

marked with the assumption that the spring balance is used on the 

Earth, with the Earth™s gravitational force attracting the object.
(b)
Fig. 5.12: (a) A hanging spring; 
(b) Two different objects hung 
from the spring
(a)
Let us learn to measure the weight using a 
spring balance
. But 
first, let us familiarise ourselves with a spring balance the way 

we did with thermometer earlier (in the chapter ‚Temperature 

and Its Measurement™ in 
Curiosity, 
Grade 6).
Activity 5.10: Let us observe
 
Look at the spring balance shown inFig.
 
5.13 carefully
. What 
is the maximum weight it can measure? 
The maximum weight it can measure is 10 N. Thus, this scale 
has a range of 0 to 10 N.

74
Let us now try to find the smallest value of weight that 
can be measured by the spring balance.
Activity 5.11: Let us calculate
 
Look at the spring balance shown in Fig. 5.13 and note 
down the following:
 
How much is the weight difference indicated 

between the two bigger marks? 
The weight difference indicated between 0 and 01 N 

or between 01 N and 02 N is 1 N.
 
How many divisions (shown by smaller marks) are 

there between these two bigger marks?
There are 5 divisions between these marks.
 
How much weight does one small division indicate? 
Fig. 5.14: Object suspended 
from a spring balance
One small division can read 
1 N
5
 = 0.2 N.
So, the smallest value that the spring balance can read is 0.2 N.
Now using this method, calculate the smallest value of weight 
that can be measured with the spring balance given to you. Your 
school laboratory may have spring balances for which the range and 

the value of the smallest division may be different. It is, therefore,  

always necessary to look carefully at the spring balance (or any 

other instrument) you are about to use.
Let us now learn how to 
measure
 weight using a spring balance.
Activity 5.12: Let us measure
 
Take a spring balance and a few objects. Keep in mind that 

the objects should not be heavier than the maximum value of 

weight the spring balance can measure, otherwise it may get 

damaged.
 
Suspendthe objects one by one from the hook (Fig. 5.14). Read 

the scale for weightcarefully and record your observations 

in the Table 5.2.

You can repeat Activities 5.10 to 5.12 for the mass scale shown 
on the left side on the spring balance (Fig. 5.13) to measure the 
mass of an object.
The mass of an object can be measured indirectly by measuring its 

weight (using a spring balance) or by comparing its weight with the 

weight of an object of a known mass (using a beam balance). Since 

the weight of an object remains almost the same everywhere on the 

Earth, so for all practical purposes it is acceptable to weigh an object  

to find its mass.
As we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‚Materials 
Around Us™ in 
Curiosity,
 Grade 6), mass is the amount 

of matter in an object and is measured in grams (g) 

or kilograms (kg). Its value remains the same at every 

place. Weight, on the other hand, is the gravitational force 

with which the Earth (or another planet) pulls an object. Since 

gravitational force can vary very slightly from place to place on 

the Earth (and can be very different on different planets), weight 

can change, but mass does not.
What is the difference 

between weight and 

mass?
The gravitational force of different planets on an object is different.  

Thus, the weight of an object is different on different planets, as shown 

in the following table, even though its mass remains the same.
Earth Moon Mars
 
1 kg1 kg
1 kg1 kg1 kg

10 N 1.6 N 3.8 N 9 N 25.4 N
In everyday life, particularly for the goods we commonly use, we 

are more interested in the amount of matter in an object (its mass),  

rather than the force applied by the Earth upon it (its weight).  

However, though while the units of mass are used, instead of the 

term mass, the term weight is typically used. For example, it is said 

that the weight of the wheat bag is 10 kg. But in scientific use, this 

is not correct and it is important to use the correct terms with their 

correct units, even if every day language is more casual.

Activity 5.13: Let us investigate
 
Take an empty plastic bottle (with its lid closed tightly) and a 
bucket full of water.
 
Push the bottle in the water (Fig. 5.15). Do you feel an upward 

push? Release the bottle. Does it bounce up?
You would have felt an upward push and the bottle bounces 
back to the surface of the water. This indicates that water applies 

a force on the bottle in the upward direction. In fact, all liquids 

applya similar force. The force applied by a liquid on an object 

in the upward direction is known as 
upthrust
 or 
buoyant force
. 
When an object is placed in a liquid, the gravitational force due 
to the Earth acts on it downwards. But a buoyant force is applied 

on it by the liquid in the upward direction. If the gravitational  

force is more than the buoyant force, the object 
sinks
, but if the 

two forces are equal, the object 
floats
. One of the factors on which 

the buoyant force depends upon, is the density of the liquid. You 

will learn about density in a later chapter of this book.
Fig. 5.15: Plastic bottle 
in water
Archimedes, a famous Greek scientist, discoveredthat whenan 

object is fully or partially immersed in a liquid, it experiences an 

upward force which is equalto the weightof the liquid it displaces. 

This is known as Archimedes™ Principle. If the weight of a liquid 

displaced by an object is smaller than the weight of the object, the 

object will sink in the liquid. If the weight of the liquid displaced is 

equal to the weight of the object, the object will float in the liquid.
5.6 Floating and Sinking 
While taking out water from 

a bucket filled with water 

using a mug, do you notice 

that the mug feels lighter 

when it is inside water? Let 

us try to 
understand
 this.
If we place some objects on water, some of 

them float, while others fall to the bottom.  

The gravitational force of the Earth is 

acting on all objects, then why don™t all 

objects fall to the bottom?

There are some rocks which can float on water. 

One such rock is Pumice, which is formed during 

volcanic eruptions. When lava with lots of gas and 

water vapour cools quickly, it traps tiny bubbles of 

gas inside.This creates a light,porous rock
 
Šfilled 
with air pock
ets which is less dense than water and floats on it.

Match items in Column A with the items in Column B.
 
A force is push or pull on an object resulting from the object™s interaction 
with another object. 
 
The SI unit of force is newton and its symbol is N. 
 
Forces can act with or without contact.
 
Muscular force and frictional force are some of the examples of contact 

forces.
 
Magnetic force, gravitational force, and electrostatic force are 

non-contact forces.
 
Force can change an object™s speed, direction of its motion, or both. Force 

can change the shape of an object.
 
The force which comes into play when an object moves or tries to move 

over another surface, is called force of friction or simply friction. It acts 

in a direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving or 

trying to move.
 
The force exerted by a magnet on another magnet or a magnetic material 

is called magnetic force.
 
The force exerted by a charged body on another charged body or 

uncharged body is called an electrostatic force.
 
The force with which the Earth attracts objects towards itself, is called 

the gravitational force. It is always an attractive force.
 
The force with which the Earth pulls an object towards itself is called the 

weight of the object. The SI unit of weight is newton (N).
 
The mass of an object remains unchanged whereas its weight may vary 

from place to place.
 
When an object is placed in a liquid, the force appliedby a liquid on an 

object in the upward direction is known as upthrust or buoyant force.

You must have observed fallen leaves on the ground swirling 
in the air or being swept away, and trees swaying or even 

bending when a strong wind blows. Have you ever wondered 

why fallen leaves rise in the air or trees sway or bend? Does the 

windexert force on fallen leaves to make them rise or on trees 

to bend?Recall other similar effects of the force exerted by wind 

like slamming of doors or rattling of windows, or fluttering of 

clothes? How does the force exerted by wind make this happen? 

The force exerted by wind creates wind pressure which causes 

these effects. In this chapter, we will 
explore
 the relationship 
between force and pressure, and understand how they shape 

powerful natural events like thunderstorms and cyclones.

Megha and her brother Pawan are going on a picnic. They walk 

to the picnic spot, carrying identical items in their bags (Fig.
 
6.1). 
On the 
way, Pawan keeps adjusting his bag, and looks 
uncomfortable. Megha asks, ﬁIs there a problem with 

your bag?ﬂ Pawan responds, ﬁYes, it is hurting my 

shoulders.ﬂ Megha says, ﬁBoth our bags are equally 

heavy. Why does your bag hurt, and mine doesn™t?ﬂ 

Pawan reflects for a minute and says, ﬁPerhaps, it is 

because of the difference in the straps of our bags. 

My bag has narrow straps while your bag has broad 

straps.ﬂ
Can the shape or size of the straps really make a 
difference? Let us try to find out.
When we carry a bag, we feel its weight because 
of the force of gravity acting on our shoulders. The 

weight of the bag with 
narrow straps
 acts on a 

smaller
 
area 
of our shoulders, whereas the weight of 
the bag with 
broad straps
 is spread out over a 
larger 

area
 of our shoulders. It is due to this reason that we feel 

more comfortable carrying a bag withbroader straps than one 

with narrow straps, although both bags have the same weight. 

Since the area over which the force acts is involved, we define 

a quantity called 
pressure
, which is the 
force per unit area
. 
So, 
 
 
Pressure =
Force
Area
At this stage, we will consider only those forces which act 
perpendicular to the surface on which the pressure is to be computed.

Broad straps reduce the pressure exerted by the bag on 
our shoulders as compared to narrow straps. Therefore, we 
feel more comfortable carrying a bag with broad straps. 
Can you now understand why it feels easier to lift a 
water-filled bucket with a broad handle than with a narrow 

handle (Fig. 6.2)? Similarly, we have seen that when people 
carry loads like pots or vegetable baskets on their heads, they 

often place a round piece of cloth under the loads (Fig.
 
6.3). In 
both cases, the objective is to reduce pressure b
y increasing 
the area over which the weight acts. 
Pressure is defined as the force per unit area. The 
SI unit 
of 
force
 is 
newton
 and that of 
area
 is 
metre
2
. Therefore, the 
SI unit 
of 
pressure
 is 
newton/metre
2
 (N/m
2
)
. This unit is also 
called a 
pascal
, denoted by 
Pa
.

a role.

What can you 
conclude
 from your observations in Table 6.1?
We conclude that when the area over which a 
force applied is smaller, the resulting pressure is 
higher, making it easier to do certain tasks. This is 

why it is easier to drive a nail using its pointed end, 

and it is easier to cut an apple with the sharp edge 

of a knife.
You must have seen overhead water tanks 
(Fig.
 
6.4) in your locality
, or on the rooftops of houses 
used for water supply. Why are these tanks always 

placed at a height?
Do liquids also exert pressure?
Let us find out by conducting the following activity.
 
Take two transparent glass or plastic pipes of the same 

length (about 25 cm), but of different diameters, as shown 

in Fig.
 
6.5. 
 
Take two good-quality rubber balloons. Attach 

them to one end of each pipe. 
 
Clampthe pipes on a stand as shown in Fig.
 
6.5.
 
Now, fill both the pipes with water up to the 

same level about halfway.
 
Observe
 what happens to the balloons.
 
Do both balloons bulge? Do they bulge to the 

same extent?
What can you 
infer
 from this activity? You must 
have observed that the two balloons bulge to the 

same extent. Why is it so? Notice that because of the 

different diameters, the weight of water in the two 

pipes is different. However, the bulge in both the 

balloons is the same. This means that the weight of 

water in the pipes could not be responsible for the 

extent of the bulge of the balloons. 
Could it be that the water column is exerting pressure? Yes, it 
is the pressure exerted by the water column which is responsible 

for the bulge. That is why equal water column heights produce 

equal bulges in the balloons, despite their different diameters.

Pour some more water in any one of the pipes 
used in Fig.
 
6.5. Observe the bulge of the balloon.
 
Repeat this process a few times, adding more 
water each time and noting the extent of bulge as 

shown in Fig. 6.6.  
Do you see any relation between the amount  
of bulge of the rubber balloon and the height of 

the water column in the pipe? You must have 

observed that the bulge of the balloon increases 

as the height of the water column increases.
Thus, as the height of the water column in the pipe increases,  
the pressure at the bottom of the pipe also increases, which causes 

the balloon to bulge more. So, we can say that the pressure exerted 

by a liquid in a vessel depends on the height of its column. This 

is the reason why overhead tanks are placed at a height so that  

the pressure in the taps is increased, resulting in a good stream of 

water from the taps. 
Suppose you are living on the second floor of a three-storeyed 
building and an overhead water tank is placed on the top floor. 

Will you or your friend on the first floor receive a more powerful 

stream of tap water? Give reasons.
....................................................................................................................
Do liquids also exert pressure on the walls of the container? 
Let us find out by conducting the following activity.
 
Take a used plastic bottle and remove its cap. Make 
four small holes near the bottom around the sides 

using a needle or a nail. Make sure that the holes are at 

the same heightfrom the bottom as shown in Fig. 6.7. 

(If you find it difficult to make a hole, you can slightly 

heat the needle and poke it to make holes.) 
 
Seal the holes with a tape and fill the bottle with water. 
 
Now, remove the tape from all holes at the same time.

You observe water flowing out through the holes on the 
sides of the bottle. What can you infer from this observation? 
It 
indicates
 that water also exerts pressure on the sides of a 
container. Therefore, we can conclude that liquids exert pressure 

not only at the bottom of the container, but also on its sides. In 

fact liquids exert pressure in all directions.
You must have seen water spurting out like a fountain from 
leaking joints or holes in water pipes. Can you explain why this 

happens?Is it due to the pressure exerted by water on the walls 

of the pipes?
Ever heard of ...
Do you know that the base of 

a dam is much broader than  

the top? This is because a  

broad base
 
not only supports
 
the structure of the dam, but 

also withstands the horizontal  

water pressure near the bottom 

(Fig. 6.8). The water stored 

in the dam, exerts pressure 

horizontally on the side walls 

of the dam and vertically on  

the floor due to the height of the water level. The pressure which 

acts horizontally, is very large near its bottom. Thus, to withstand the 

pressure, the base of the dam is made broader.
Fig. 6.8: Dam
Let us now try to understand if air also exerts pressure.
6.2 Pressure Exerted by Air
You already know that air is all around us. The envelope of air 

surrounding the Earth is called 
atmosphere
. Theatmospheric 

air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and other 

gases in small quantities. The atmosphere extends up to many 

kilometres above the surface of the Earth.
Let us findout if the atmosphere exerts pressure by performing 
the following activity.
Activity 6.3: Let us explore
 
Take a paper plate, invert it and attach a stick to it as shown 

in Fig. 6.9a. Place it on a plain surface.

stick to come

the folded sheet on top 
of the inverted paper plate as shown in Fig.
 
6.9b.
 
Now, try to lift the paper plate covered with a 
folded sheet using the stick.
 
Observe how much effort is needed to lift it.
 
Now, place the second unfolded chart paper 

sheet in place of the folded sheet. Make a hole at 

the centre of this chart paper for the stick to pass 

through. Cover the paper plate with the unfolded 

chart paper as shown in Fig. 6.9
 
c.
 
 
Lift the paper plate again and feel the effort 

needed in doing so.
 
In which case is the lifting easier, with the folded 

or the unfolded chart paper covering the paper 

plate?
You would have observed that more effort is 
needed to lift the paper plate when it is covered with 

the unfolded chart paper, than with the folded chart 

paper. When we cover the paper plate with unfolded 

chart paper, the area of the covering sheet increases. 
The effort needed to lift the paper plate increases. 
Notice that the weight of the covering sheet has not 

changed. What can you infer from this? We can 

infer from these observations that air exerts force 
on the covering sheet, which makes it difficult to lift 
the paper plate. Moreover, this force increases with 
Fig. 6.10: A girl 
blowing a balloon
Fig. 6.9: (c) Inverted paper plate 
with unfolded chart paper
Fig. 6.9: (b) Inverted paper plate 
with two folds of chart paper
increase in the area of covering sheets. It means that the air is 
exerting a force on the paper plate, whichincreases as the area of 

the sheet covering it increases. As force per unit area is pressure, 

we can conclude that air exerts pressure on the paper sheet. In 

fact, air exerts pressure on all objects. The pressure exerted by 

air around us is known as the 
atmospheric pressure
. 
You must have experienced that when you blow air into a 
balloon, it gets inflated. Why? This is because the air being filled 

inside the balloon exerts pressure on the walls of the balloon 

(Fig
 
6.10). Can we sa
y that air exerts pressure in all directions? Yes, 
that is why the balloon expands in all directions. What happens 

when an inflated balloon is kept without closing its mouth? The 

air escapes from the balloon. Why does the air escape from 

the balloon?

87
Have you ever wondered how large the atmospheric pressure 
is? Let us get an idea about its magnitude by performing the 
following activity.
Activity 6.4: Let us perform
 
Take a good-quality rubber sucker. Press it firmly against a 

smooth flat surface (Fig. 6.11). 
 
Do you realise that it sticks to the surface?
 
Now, try to pull it off. Do you find it difficult to pull it off? 
When we press the sucker, most of the air between its cup 
and the surface on which it is placed is pushed out and the air 

pressure inside it is reduced. The sucker sticks to the surface 

because the pressure of air surrounding the sucker is higher 

than the pressure exerted by the air inside the sucker. To pull the 

sucker off the surface, the applied force should be strong enough 

to overcome the pressure difference between outside the sucker 

and inside the sucker.
Do you know how large the atmospheric pressure is? The force 
exerted by the atmospheric air column over an area 15 cm × 15
 
cm
 
is nearly equal to the force of gravity on an object of mass 225 kg 

(2250 N). The reason we are not crushed under this weight is that 

the pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric 

pressure. This balances the pressure exerted from outside. The 

pressure inside our body is caused by the movement of fluids and 

gases in tissues and organs of the body.
6.3 Formation of Wind
You must have noticed that on some days, the wind blows strongly, 

whereas on other days, it is calm. Sometimes, wind becomes so 

strong that it causes damage to life and property. 
You must have seen that when an inflated balloon is kept 
without closing its mouth, the air from the balloon escapes. Recall 

that when there is a puncture in the bicycle tube, the air escapes 

and the tube collapses. In both of these cases, does air move from 

a high pressure region to a low pressure region?  
The SI unit of pressure is N/m
2
, also known as pascal (Pa). However, 
the practical unitof air pressure is millibar (mb), which is equal to 

100
 
Pa. Air pressure 
is also expressed in hectopascal (hPa), which is 
equal to 100 Pa.

Let us find out from the following activity.
Activity 6.5: Let us observe
 
Take two similar balloons made of thin rubber, 
and a drinking straw.
 
Insert one end of the straw into one balloon and 

secure it with a rubber band or thread.
 
Now inflate the second balloon and holdits mouth 

with your fingers, so that air does not escape.
 
Insert the free end of the straw into the neck of 

the inflated balloon and secure it witha rubber 
band or thread. Make sure that the air does not leak from the 

balloon as the straw is inserted in it. Now you have one end 

of the straw inside the inflated balloon and the other end 

inside the uninflated balloon as shown in Fig. 6.12.
 
Predict
 what would happen to the balloons.
 
Observe what happens to both the balloons. Did it happen as 

predicted?
 
Do you observe any change in the size of the balloons? Write 

down your observations.
....................................................................................................................
What can be the reason for the change in the sizes of the 
balloons? The air pressure in the inflated balloon is higher 
than that in the uninflated balloon. As a result, some air moves 

from the inflated balloon to the uninflated balloon, resulting in 

changes in the size of both the balloons.
Do you notice that after some time boththe balloons attain 
almost the same size and the flow of air stops? Why does the air 

flow stop? The flow of air continues till the air pressure in the 

inflated balloon is higher than the air pressure in the uninflated 

balloon. The air flow stops when the pressure in both balloons 

becomes equal. At this stage, both balloons are almost of the 

same size. Thus, we can conclude that air moves from a region of 

high air pressure to a region of low air pressure. 
You can relate this conclusion to the directions of the sea breeze 
and land breeze, which you studied in 
Curiosity,
 Grade 7. As land 
gets heated faster than water during the day, the air above the land 
How do winds form?
Does the difference in air 

pressure have anything to do 

with the formation of winds?

becomes warmer and lighter. Hence, it rises, creating an area of low 
pressure. The air from the high pressure region of the sea blows to 

the low pressure region which develops on the land, resulting in a  

sea breeze. At night, the water is warmer than the land. Therefore,  

a low pressure area develops above the sea. As a result, wind 

blows from the land to the sea, giving rise to land breeze. Thus, the 

phenomenon of land breeze and sea breeze is mainly due to the 

pressure differences over the land and the sea.
If we could measure the speed of the escaping air in Activity
 
6.5, 
we 
wouldfindthat the speed of the air is higher if the pressure 
difference is higher.
I have read that high-speed 
winds can blow off roofs.
I wonder how?
6.4 
 
High-Speed Winds Result in Low
ering 
of Air Pressure
Activity 6.6: Let us observe
 
Take two balloons of the same size.
 
Inflate both balloons and tie strings to them.
 
Hang the two balloons from a stick, leaving a 
gap of 6Œ10 cm (Fig. 6.13).
 
Now, blow air into the narrow space between 

the balloons.
 
What happens to the balloons? Note down 

your observations.
 
Now blow harder and observe.
When you blow between the two balloons, you observe that they  
move towards each other. This happens because when you blow 

air between the balloons, a low pressure area is created between  

them. The higher air pressure surrounding the balloon pushes 

them towards each other. You must have observed that blowing  

harder increases the speed at which the balloons approach each 

other. What can you infer from this activity? We infer that high 

speed winds are accompanied by a reduced air pressure.

When high-speed winds blow over houses, 
a low-pressure area is created over them, 
as high-speed winds are accompanied by a 

reduced pressure. Therefore, the air pressure 

above the roofs of the houses is lower than the 

pressure below them. If the pressure difference 

is large and the roofs are weak, they may be 

blown away, as shown in Fig. 6.14
 
a. Thatis 
wh
y it is safer to keep doors and windows of 
the houses open during storms with high-speed 

winds. When the same wind moves over the 

roofs, and through the houses, the pressure 

difference between inside of the houses and 

over the roofs is reduced to a large extent. This 

helps prevent the roofs from being blown off as 

shown in Fig. 6.14
 
b.
You must have experienced that when 
high-speed 
windsblow duringstorms, they 
are sometimes accompanied by thunder and 

lightning. Let us learn more about them.
6.5 Storms, Thunderstorms, and Lightning
Fig. 6.14: (b) Roof of a house intact
Fig. 6.14: (a) Roof of a house 
blown away
Have you heard the sound of 

thunder and seen lightning 

during the rainy season?
Yes, the sound of thunder 

is so frightening! Usually 

there is heavy rainfall too.
When land gets heated, the warm and moist air, being 

lighter, rises, thereby creating a low pressure area. Cooler 

air from the surrounding high-pressure areas flows to 

take its place. This air, in turn, gets heated and rises. 

This results in a continuous process of wind circulation.
 
As the rising air expands, it cools and moisture in it 

condenses to form water droplets, creating clouds. 

The water droplets merge to form heavier drops, 

whichcome down as rain, hail, or snow. The strong 

winds accompanied by rain is called a 
storm
. In hot, 

humid,and tropical regions like India, storms are 

more frequent. Under certain conditions, warm air 

rises to great heights that the low temperature there 

converts water droplets into ice particles.
Strong winds blowing upwards and downwards 
(Fig. 6.15) facilitate rubbing between water droplets

 Fig. 6.17: Safe position 
during lightning
and ice particles. You have learnt in the chapter 
‚Exploring Forces™ that when two objects are rubbed 

against each other, they get charged. In this case, strong 

winds blowing upwards and downwards and rubbing 

against each other cause static electric charges to 

develop within the clouds.
The positively charged lighter ice particles move 
upwards and occupy the upper part of the clouds. The 

negatively charged heavier water droplets occupy the 

lower part of the clouds.Thus, a charge separation 

within the cloud takes place. Also, when the negatively 

charged lower part of the cloud moves closer to the 

ground, it causes the ground and nearby objects, such as trees or 

buildings, to become positively charged (Fig. 6.16).
Normally, air acts as an electrical insulator and does not 
let opposite charges meet. But when the build up of charges 

becomes very large, the insulating property of air breaks down. 

A sudden flow of charges takes place, producing a bright flash of 

light called 
lightning
.
Lightning can occur as opposite charges collide withina cloud, 
between clouds, or between clouds andthe ground. Lightning 

rapidly heats up the air around it, causing the air to expand and 

produce a loud sound known as 
thunder
. A storm accompanied 

by lightning and thunder is called a 
thunderstorm
.
A step further
Isolated and localised thunderstorms can sometimes occur in various 

regions of India. These thunderstorms are known by various names 

such as 
Kalboishakhi
 in West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand and 

Bordoisila
 in Assam. They occur before the arrival of the monsoon, 

thereby helping kharif crops to grow. In Kerala, Karnataka, and 

Tamil Nadu, they are known as mango showers as they support the 

ripening of mangoes. Local thunderstorms in Karnataka help in the 

growth of coffee plants.
Lightning can be dangerous! It can ignite fires,  
damage buildings, and cause severe burns or death 

in humans and animals. We must take necessary  

precautions and protect ourselves from lightning. 

During lightning, stay away from tall objects, find a 

low-lying open area and crouch down, and minimise 

contact with the ground. Do not lie down flat. Avoid 

using an umbrella with a metallic rod. If you are in 

water, get out of it. If you are inside a bus or a car, you 

are comparatively safer.

Ever heard of ...
A lightning conductor is a 
metallic rod installed along the 

walls of buildings during their 

construction. One end of the 

rod is pointed. This end is kept 

higher than the highest point of 

the building (Fig. 6.18). The other 

end of the rod is burieddeep in 

the ground. The rod provides 

easy path for the transfer of 

electric charges into the ground.

6.6 Cyclone
Cyclones
 are large storms that form over warm ocean waters. 
As the ocean water gets heated, the warm and moist air above 

it rises. As the moist air rises, the water vapour condenses to 
form raindrops. We know that during evaporation, 

water takes up heat to change into vapour. When 

this water vapour condenses into raindrops, heat is 

released back into the atmosphere. This causes further 

warming of the ascending air leading it to rise even 

further, creating an even lower pressure. Air from the 

surrounding regions rushes in and it also starts rising. 

Earth™s rotation causes the moving air to spin (Fig. 6.19). 

This cycle is repeated, resulting in the creation of a very 

low-pressure area with high-speed winds revolving 

around it. This spinning system of clouds, winds, and 

rain is called a
 cyclone
.
In a cyclone, the region of lowest 
pressure is at the centre, known as the 
eye 

of the cyclone
. At the eye of the cyclone, 

the wind is calm, but the surrounding 

region experiences strong winds and 

heavy rainfall. As a cyclone moves from the 

ocean towards the land, it generates higher 

windspeeds compared to the windspeeds 

produced by regular thunderstorms. Once 

the cyclone reaches land, the source of 

moist air is cut off and it gradually loses its 

strength.

93
Even as a cyclone loses its strength while travelling over land,  
it leaves behind a trail of destruction that can take months or even 
years to repair. Cyclones can be extremely destructive. For example,  

the Amphan cyclone in 2020 had peak wind speeds of 270 km/h.  
Strong winds during a cyclone  push ocean water towards the 
shore, creating a wall of water that can be as high as 3Œ12 metres. 

This surge of water can flood coastal areas and even areas far 

from the sea. The heavy rainfall which accompanies a cyclone  

may cause rivers to overflow and can also trigger landslides. 
Seawater that rushes inland can contaminate drinking water 
sources and damage farmland. The salt in seawater can make soil 

less fertile, affecting crops. Roads may get blocked due to fallen 

trees and debris, making it difficult for help to reach the affected 

areas. Power outages can last for days, disruptingemergency 

services and daily life. 
How can we protect ourselves duringcyclones? It is important 
to stay updated on weather reports and periodic alerts, and 

warnings issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). 

Thanks to the weather monitoring satellites, today we can 

track cyclones and predict their path,helping us reduce their 

impact on life and property. Several national and international 

organisations work together to monitor cyclone-related disasters. 

If you live in a cyclone-prone area, keep an emergency kit ready 

with essential items. During a cyclone, quickly move to a nearby 

designated cyclone shelter.
Let us wrap up!
Cool air rushes to occupy the low-pressure area.
Warm air rises, creating a low-pressure area.
Warm air rises, cools, and the water vapour condenses to 
form clouds.
Bigger water drops in the clouds fall to the ground as rain, 

hail, or snow.
Positive and negative charges are created in the clouds by 

strong winds blowing upwards and downwards.
Under certain weather conditions, storms may develop into 

cyclones.
When positive and negative charges meet, they cause 

lightning. Lightning may occur within a cloud, between 

clouds, or between a cloud and the ground.

The SI unit of pressure is newton/metre
2
 (N/m
2
) and is also called 
pascal denoted by Pa.
 
Liquids and gases exert pressure on the walls of a container. 
 
The pressure exerted by the air around us is known as atmospheric 

pressure.
 
Differences in air pressure cause winds to blow. 
 
Warm air rises, creating a low-pressure area. Cooler air from 

surrounding higher-pressure regions moves in to take its place. 
 
Important requirements for the formation of thunderstorms are 

moisture and strong winds. 
 
Strong winds moving upwards and downwards facilitate rubbing 

of ice particles with water droplets, causing electric charges to 

develop in clouds.
 
Collision of electric charges withina clouds, or between clouds, or 

between a cloud and the ground causes lightning. 
 
Lightning strikes can cause destruction to life and property.
 
Lightning conductors protect buildings from the effects of 

lightning.

You might have collecte d pebbles and stones from the sand while 
playing on a riverbank or a beach. Where do these pebbles, 

stones, and sand come from? 
In the mountains, rocks gradually break down due to erosion. 
Rivers flowing through these regions carry along the eroded rock 

pieces. As the rivers flow, they continue to break down the rocks 

further into pebbles, stones, sand; and transport large quantities 

of them to the plains.
The bigger rocks are eventually broken down into finer grains 
of sand and clay. Is this grain the smallest unit of a bigger rock 

or can these grains of sand and clay be broken down further?
 

Let us find out!
7.1 What Is Matter Composed of?
    
Activity 7.1: Let us explore
 
Take a stick of chalk (Fig. 7.1a) and break it into two 

pieces (Fig. 7.1b). 
 
Continue breaking the chalk till it becomes difficult 

to break it further by hand.
 
Grind the small pieces of chalk thus obtained 

(Fig.
 
7.1c) using mortar and pestle.
 
Observe
 the fine powder of chalk with a magnifying 

glass (Fig. 7.1d).
 
What do you observe?
 
Each tiny grain you observe is still a speck of chalk.
               
Is every speck of this fine 

chalk powder still composed 

of the same substance, 

or has it changed into 

something else on breaking 

or grinding?
Recall 
Curiosity,
 Grade 7 chapter ‚Changes Around 
Us: Physical and Chemical™Š is grinding chalk a physical 

change or a chemical change? You learnt that the chalk 

does not change into a new substance on grinding. It is a 

physical change in which only the size of each speck of 

chalk has reduced further.

These specks of chalk powder can be broken further into 
smaller particles by further grinding. Let us imagine that this 
process of grinding continues. Eventually, we would reach a stage 

where the chalk particles cannot be broken down any further. 
The tiny units obtained at this stage 

are the basic building blocks that the 

chalk was made up of. 
This means that one whole piece of 
chalk was made up of a large number 

of smaller units. These units are called 
constituent particles of chalk. A 
constituent particle
 is the basic 

unit that makes up a larger piece of a substance or material. Just 

like chalk, the grains of sand and clay are not the smallest units 

of bigger rocks. These are also made up of a large number of 

their constituent particles.
Let us 
explore
 further!

Recall  the  dissolution  of  sugar  into  water  to  form  a  solution. 
What happens to sugar when it is dissolved in water?
Activity 7.2: Let us perform
 
Fill a glass tumbler with 
drinking water. 
 
Put two teaspoons of sugar 

into it.
 
Do not stir the water. Taste a 

small spoonful of water from 

the top layer of the glass.
Does the water taste sweet? 
 
Now, stir the water until the sugar dissolves completely 

(Fig.
 
7.2). 
 
Again taste a spoonful of water from the top layer.
What difference in taste do you notice? Does it taste sweet? 
Since the top layer of water tastes sweet after dissolving 
sugar, it must be present in the solution. Do you observe any 

sugar particles in the solution? 
Sugar particles can no longer be observed but their 
presence can be sensed by taste. When sugar dissolves in 

water, it breaks up into its constituent particles which cannot 

be broken down further. Each tiny grain of sugar is made up 

of millions and millions of such constituent particles.
Are the units of chalk 

obtained in this manner 

considered the smallest 

units of chalk?

101
Activities 7.1 and 7.2 support the idea that matter is composed 
of a large number of extremely small particles. These particles 
are so small that they cannot be seen even through an ordinary 

microscope.
But, where did 

the sugar go?
The tiny sugar particles separate and occupy the available 
spaces between the water particles. These spaces between the 

particles are known as 
interparticle spaces
. 
Chalk and sugar can both 

be broken down into their 

constituent particles. But how 

are the constituent particles 

held together to form the solid 

pieces we see?
7.2 What Decides Different States of Matter?
The constituent particles of matter are held together through 

forces which are attractive in nature. These forces are called 

interparticle attractions
. The strength of these attractions 

depends on the nature of the substance and the interparticle 

distance. Even a slight increase in the distance decreases the 

interparticle forces drastically. The strength of these forces 

ultimately decides the physical state of the substances.
Do you know that since ancient times, people have been thinking 

about how far things could be broken down and what is matter 

made up of?
 
Acharya Kanad, an ancient Indian philosopher, first 
spoke 
about the idea of a 
Parmanu
 (atom). He believed that matter is 
made up of tiny, indivisible eternal particles called 
Parmanu
. 

This idea was written in his work called 
Vaisheshika Sutras
.

102
Let us
 
explore how these attractions vary in different states.
7.2.1 Solid state
How are constituent particles held together in 
solids
?
 
Collect
 a few solid objects, such as a piece 
of iron or an iron nail, a piece of rock salt, 

a stone, a piece of wood, a key, and a piece 

of aluminium (Fig. 7.3). 
 
Observe their shapes and sizes.
 
Try hammering them.
 
In which of the above six objects do 

you
 
thinkparticles 
are strongly held 
together?
You must have noticed that all these 
objects are solids. They have a 
definite shape
 
and 
volume
. This is due to the fact that in solids, the particles 
are tightly packed and the interparticle attractions are very 

strong. These strong forces of attraction hold the particles in 

fixed positions, preventing them from moving freely (Fig. 7.4a). 
The particles can only move to and fro about their 

positions (vibrate or oscillate) but cannot move 

past each other.
When solids are heated, their particles vibrate 
more vigorously (Fig. 7.4b). A stage is reached 

when these vibrations become so vigorous that the 
particles start leaving their position. The interparticle forces of 

attraction get weakened andthe solid gets converted into the 

liquid state (Fig. 7.4c). The temperature at which this happens is 

the melting point of the solid.

103
The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become 
a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its
 melting point
. 
Generally, in a liquid state, particles are somewhat farther away 

from each other as compared to those in the solid state (ice is an 

exceptionŠits particles are farther apart than those in water). 
Some solids have weak interparticle forces of attraction, so 
their melting points are low. While others have strong attractive 

forces and have high melting points. Some examples of solids 

and their melting points are shown in Table

Fig. 7.5: Water placed in containers of different shapes

Take three clean and dry containers of different shapes. 
Label them A, B, and C (Fig. 7.5). 
 
Mark the 200 mL level in each container using a marker or 

by pasting a thin strip of paper. 
 
Fill Container A with water up to the marked level.
 
Carefully transfer the water from Container A to Container
  
B 
without spilling, and observe the shape and level 
of the 
water.
 
Now, transfer the same water from Container B to Container
 
C, 
carefully, and observe the shape and its level again. 
Y
ou will notice that the water takes the shape of the container 
into which it is poured. So, we can say that the 
liquids 
do not 
have a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are 

kept in. This happens because the particles of liquids are free to 

move. In all three containers, the water level remains at 200 mL 

and no change in volume is observed. Hence, we can say that 

liquids have a 
definite volume
. However, if a container is not 
clean, some water may stick to its walls, causing the water level 

in the next container to be slightly less than 200 mL after pouring.
Activity 7.4 shows that the particles of liquids can 
move freely, but only within a limitedspace. Therefore, 

we can 
infer
 that liquids have no fixed shape but have 

a fixed volume.
Let us now 
compare
 interparticle forces of 
attraction in liquids and solids. Take some water in a 

shallow vessel and try to move your finger through it 

(Fig. 7.6).
Are you able to move your finger through the water?

105
You can move your finger through water without breaking 
or cutting it permanently, which cannot be done in the case of 
solids. When you try this, you are temporarily displacing water. 

As soon as you remove your finger, the position of the water is 

restored. We can say that in liquids, the interparticle attractions 

are slightly weaker than in solids, but still strong enough to keep 

the particles close together. 
Recall 
Curiosity, 
Grade 6 chapter ‚Temperature and Its 
Measurement™, where you observed the temperature of boiling 

water (liquid). When a liquid is heated, a stage comes when 

it starts boiling. The temperature at which a liquid boils and 

turns into vapour at atmospheric pressure is called its 
boiling 

point
. The movement of particles becomes so vigorous that they 

move apart from each other, resulting 

in a decrease in the interparticle forces 

of attraction. Eventually, the constituent 

particles can escape from the liquid state. 

The liquid is converted into vapour or the 

gaseous
 
state.
At the boiling point, the formation of vapour is very fast and 
occurs not only at the surface but 
also within the liquid. This 
process is observed as bubble formation in the liquid. However, 

vapour formation occurs at all temperatures, even below the 

boiling point, thoughslowly and only at the surface. Thisslower 

process is known as evaporation
 
Š about which you have learnt 
in  earlier grades.
7.2.3 Gaseous state
Do gases also have 

a fixed volume?
 
Take two transparent gas jars or glass tumblers 

and mark them A and B. 
 
Create some smoke by burning an incense stick. 
 
Hold the Gas Jar A upside down over the smoke (Fig. 7.7a). 
 
The gas jar should trap the smoke inside.
 
Turn it over and cover it with a glass plate (Fig. 7.7b).
 
Hold another Gas Jar B upside down and gently place it over 

the glass plate covering the Gas Jar A.
I have seen that spilled 

water disappears after 

some time, and it happens 

at any temperature!
Be careful while burning 

an incense stick.

6/28/2025   2:53:06 PM

106
 
Remove the glass plate slowly 
and ensure that both gas jars 

are close enough and there is 

no gap for smoke to escape 

(Fig. 7.7c).
 
Observe how the smoke 

spreads inside the Gas Jar B. 
 
The smoke fills the entire 

space in the Gas Jar B, 

indicatingthat gases do not 

have a fixed volume and tend 

to occupy the entire available 

space (Fig.
 
7.7d). Like liquids, 
they 
also acquire the shape 
of the vessel they are in.
This illustrates that the 
particles in gases move freely in 

all directions and the interparticle 

attractions are negligible. As a  

result, gases do not have a fixed 

shape or volume.
In this activity, smoke is used to 
represent the gaseous state. The
 
tiny 
particles of smoke suspended 
in the air are constantly hit by invisible particles of gases, and their 

movement helps us observe the motion of gas particles.  
This activity can also be demonstrated by using iodine vapour 
instead of smoke from incense sticks.  
Iodine vapour can be obtained by 
placing some solid iodine in a closed gas 

jar for some time, as shown in Fig. 7.8.  
Bothliquids and gases flow and 
do not retain a fixed shape. These 

properties distinguish them from 

solids and 
classify
 them as 
fluids

7.3 
 
How Does the Interp
article Spacing 
Differ in the Three States of Matter? 
What role does the interparticle spacing play in determining the 
properties of each state (solid, liquid, and gas)?
Let us 
perform
 the following activities to find answers to 
these questions.
Activity 7.6: Let us experiment
 
Take a syringe without a needle. Pull the plunger of the 

syringe outwards in a fully extended position (Fig. 7.9a).
 
Place your thumb over the open end of the syringe to prevent 

the air present inside the syringe from escaping (Fig. 7.9b). 
 
Push the plunger slowly and steadily inward (Fig.
 
7.9c).

plunger outwards
(b) Placing thumb 
over the open end
(c) Pushing the 
plunger inwards
Syringe 
without a 
needle
 
What do you observe?
As you do this, you will notice that the volume of air inside the 
syringe decreases.
What can we say about the behaviour of gas in the syringe?
 
When you compress the air by pushing the plunger, the 
particles are forced to come closer. This shows that the gas 

particles have a lot of space between them in their natural state, 

and this space can be reduced by applying external pressure.
If you stop pushing the plunger, the gas particles spread, and 
the plunger moves back to its original position.
Repeat this activity using water and observe.
You would observe that water is practically incompressible.

Let us perform another activity to learn about the interparticle 
spaces in liquids.

Activity 7.7: Let us observe
 
Take a glass vessel, fill it about half with water, and mark the 
level of water A (Fig. 7.10a).
 
Add two teaspoons of sugar into it. 
 
Mark the new water level on the glass vessel B  (Fig. 7.10b). 
 
Stir the water with a glass rod to dissolve the sugar (Fig. 7.10c).  
 
Predict 
whether the water level will increase or decrease 
with respect to the mark B. 
 
Mark this water level again as C (Fig. 7.10d).

Dissolving 
Sugar  
in water
What difference do you observe in the water levels?
You will observe that initially, when sugar is added, the level 
of water increases, but after dissolution, it may decrease to some 

extent. Since the volume of the solution is less than the sum of 
the volumes of water and sugar, it indicates that 

there is some space between the water particles. 

Theparticles of the dissolved substance occupy 

these spaces (Fig. 7.11). 
Repeat the Activity 7.7 with some other soluble 
solids, such as common salt or glucose, and 

insoluble solids, like sand and stone pieces.
What do you observe in each case? Do the sand 
particles dissolve? Does the volume of water in 

the vessel change after mixing, and why?
Sugar and sand are both 

solids. Why does sugar

Sandis a solidthat does not dissolve 
in water. When added to water, the sand 
particles settle down and occupy some 

space in the container, causing the total 

volume to increase.
What do you think about the interparticle 
spacing in solids?
You learnt earlier that the constituent  
particles in solids are held together by strong 

forces of attraction. So, these particles do 

not move from one place to another and 

are closely packed. However, despite close 

packing, some space is left between the 

particles as shown in Fig. 7.12a. You might 

assume that the space between particles is 

filled with air, but this is not the case. They 

contain nothing at all. Fig.
 
7.12 summarises
 
the packing of particles and the interparticle 

spacing in the three states of matter.
Often, we use the term ‚particle™ in different contexts. The meaning 

of this term changes with the context. For example, while talking 

about air pollution, the term Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) 

is used. Thisterm refers to the tiny dust particles suspended in air 

and not the constituent particles of matter which are extremely 

small as compared to the dust particles. In fact, even these tiny dust 

particles are also made upof a very large numberof constituent 

particles, i.e, atoms and molecules.

How Particles Move in Different States

Let us find out about the movement of particles in the three states 

of matter.
Activity 7.8: Let us experiment 
 
Take a glass tumbler containing 

water and put a few grains of 

potassium permanganate into it.
 
What do you observe?

Initially, you will see some streaks of 
pink colour spreading out from the grain 

(Fig.
 
7.13a). 
 
With the passage of time, the entire bulk of 

water will acquire a uniform pink colour 

(Fig.
 
7.13b).
 
Do you know why this happens?
This happens because the water particles 
are in constant motion. First they pull out the 

particles of potassium permanganate from its 

grain, and later they hit these particles so that 

they get spread throughout the liquid. In the case 

of many substances, the constituent particles 
are held together strongly that the water particles are unable to 

pull these out. Such substances, like sand, are insoluble in water.
Try it yourself!
 
Take three clean glass tumblers.
 
Pour hot water in one of them, water at room temperature in the 

second and ice-cold water in the third.
 
Drop a small grain of potassium permanganate into each of them.  
 
Watch carefully and compare. What do you observe?
Water particles move faster in hot water compared to water at 

room temperature, and even slower in ice-cold water. As a result, 

the potassium permanganate spreads the fastest in hot water, less 

quickly in water at room temperature, and the slowest in ice-cold 

water. Hence, the movement of particles increases when heat is 

provided.
Try to depict it by 
drawing
 a diagram.
How can we 
demonstrate
 

the movement of gas 

particles that cannot be 

seen with the naked eye?

Fig. 7.14: Burning of an incense stick
When an incense stick is burnt in one corner of the room, 
initially, the fragrance is felt only around the incense stick. Shortly, 
you can smell the fragrance throughout the room. This
 
happens 
becausethe 
particles of the fragrance spread, filling the entire 
room. This shows that the particles of air are moving constantly. 

The air particles hit the particles of the fragrance and help them 

spread throughout the room.
Oh! Now I know why 

and how the fragrance of 

perfume reaches us.
Can you share a few other real-life situations where you have 
experienced the movement of gas particles?

The particulate nature of matter 

plays a crucial role in many 

everyday processes. For example, 

when we wash clothes stained 

with oil using soap, numerous 

soap particles surround the oil 

particles on the fabric. One end 

of the soap particle attaches to 

the oil, and the other mixes with 

water, thus helping lift the oil off 

and wash it away (Fig. 7.15).

Based on our learnings from the chapter, we can say that matter 
is made up of small particles which are held together by the force 
of attraction. The strength of attractive forces between particles 

depends on the distance between them, which in turn depends 

on their thermal (heat) energy. Thus, it is the thermal energy of 

the particles that determines the physical state of matter. In the 

solid state, the thermal energy of particles is low, so they remain 

close to each other and experience strong interparticle attractive 

forces. This restricts their motion to only small vibrations.
At the melting point, the thermal energy is used to overcome 
the attractive forces between particles, allowing the solid to 

change into a liquid. At this stage, the particles can move away 

from their fixed positions. The interparticle distance increases 

slightly, reducing the strength of the attractive forces to a level 

that allows the particles to move around, though still within a 

limited space. In the gaseous state, the particles have enough 

energy to overcome the forces of attraction between them and 

move freely in all directions. You will learn more about these 

particles that constitute matter in higher grades.
Let us wrap up!

Debate in the class Š ‚Gases can spread and fill all the available

The tiny particles that make upall matter are atoms and molecules.  

For example, iron is made up of atoms of iron, and gold is made up 

of atoms of gold. Atoms of many elements like hydrogen, oxygen, 

and sulfur are not able to exist independently. In such cases, a 

certain number of atoms of the same element combine to form a 

molecule. For example, two atoms of hydrogen combine and form 

a stable particle called a molecule of hydrogen. A water molecule 

is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. You will 

learn about atoms and molecules in higher grades.

Have you ever wondered what the world around you is made 
of? Look around! The staircase you use, the air you breathe, the 

water in your bottle, the food in your lunch box, the clothes and 

shoes you wear, the book you read, the trees outside, the ball you 

play with and even the stick you carry
 
Š
 
all of these are examples 
of 
matter
, which you have learnt in earlier grades. 
You have also learnt that all these things are made up of tiny 
particles. Most of the things around us are not made of just one 

substance; rather they are made up of two or more substances 

mixed together. Let us now understand how different substances 

come together to form mixtures.
8.1 What Are Mixtures?
Have you ever wondered what makes 

your 
poha
 (Fig. 8.1) so delicious or how 
to make the perfect sprout salad? While 

these dishes may seem very different, they 

share something in commonŠthey are 

bothmade by mixingseveral ingredients. 

We 
observe
 the mixing of substances in 
everyday life. Sugar dissolved in water 

is also a mixture, and so are soups and 

lemonade. 
When two or more substances are 
mixed, where each substance retains 

its properties, it is called a 
mixture
. 

The individual substances that make up 

a mixture are called its 
components
. 

The components of a mixture do not 

react chemically with each other. In some 

mixtures, the components
 
Š
 
like green 
gr
am, chickpeas, onion, and tomato 
in a sprout salad (Fig. 8.2), are easy to 

see. Such mixtures, where the different 
components are generally visible with the naked eye or with a 

magnifying device, are 
non-uniform
 
in nature. Can you 
identify
 
a few more examples of non-uniform mixtures around you?
On the other hand, some mixtures have components that 
cannot be seen separately even with the help of a microscope.
 

For example, sugar and water particles cannot be seen separately 

in their mixture. Such types of mixtures, where the components 

are evenly distributed and cannot be distinguished, are 
uniform
 

in nature (Fig.
 
8.3). Can you list a few uniform mixtures?

Mishraloha
 was the name given to the mixture of two or more metals 
that had properties distinct from its constituent metals. Ancient 

Indian texts, such as the 
Charaka Samhita
, 
Susruta Samhita
, 
Rasaratna 
Samucchaya
, 
Rasa Jala Nidhi
, etc., mention the use of alloys for 
medicinalpurposes. For example, Bronze, also known as 
Kamsya
, is 
an alloy made upof Copper (
Tamra
, 4 parts) and Tin(
Vanga
, 1 part), 

was used to improve digestion and boost immunity.
8.1.1 Is air a mixture?
In
 Curiosity,
 Grade 6, you learnt about air and its composition in 

the chapter ‚Nature™s Treasures™. Is air a mixture? What kind of 

mixture is it? 
You have learnt that air is a uniform mixture of mainly  
nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapour. Out of 

these, oxygen is required by most of the living beings to stay alive.  

It also helps in combustion. Nitrogen, which constitutes about 78%  

of the air, does not take part in combustion. We also learnt that air 

has water vapour in it. When warm air touches a cool surface, the 

water vapour turns into liquid water, forming tiny droplets. Recall 

the experiment where you tested the presence of carbon dioxide 

in the air that we exhale. Let us 
confirm
 the presence of carbon  
dioxide in the air.

 
Take a glass tumbler and fill it half with water.
 
Add a small amount of calcium oxide 

(quick lime) slowly to
 
it.
 
What do you observe?
 
Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with 
water to form calcium hydroxide and releases heat. 
Perform this step carefully.
Do you know that stainless steel is also a mixture?  

Stainless steel contains iron, nickel, chromium,  

and a small amount of carbon. They are mixed 

so uniformly that the entire mixture appears 

the same throughout and one cannot see the 

individual substances. Such mixtures are known  

as alloys. Brass, a mixture of copper and zinc,  

and bronze, a mixture of copper and tin, are 

some other examples of alloys (Fig. 8.4).

stainless steel, brass, and bronze

Stir continuously to make a solution of calcium 
hydroxide. This solution is called lime water.
 
Filter it and observe its colour.
 
Leave this colourless solution in a petri dish for a few 

hours (Fig. 8.5a).
 
Keep stirring the solution at regular intervals.
 
What do you observe (Fig. 8.5b)? 
 
Does it turn milky? 
Can you 
explain
 why the solution has turned milky?
You know that lime water turns milky when carbon 
dioxide reacts with calcium hydroxide to form calcium 

carbonate (insoluble tiny white particles) and water 

(Fig. 8.5). Since lime water turns milky when exposed to 

air, this activity 
demonstrates
 the presence of carbon 

dioxide in the air. 
Calcium hydroxide + Carbon dioxide 
 Calcium carbonate + Water
Apart from gases, have you ever observed anything 
else present in the air? Have you ever noticed tiny shining 

particles moving in a beam of sunlight entering a dark room 

through a small opening? What are these particles? 

 
Take a black sheet of paper. Ensure that it is free from 

any visible dust particles.
 
Place the black sheet of paper undisturbed near an open 

window (Fig. 8.6a), or in the garden, for a few hours.
 
What do you observe?
You may notice tiny particles settled on its surface. You 
may use a magnifying glass to 
examine
 the particles more 

closely (Fig. 8.6b).
This shows that dust particles are suspended in the air. 
They are not an integral part of the air and are considered 

pollutants. Thenature and the numberof dustparticles in 

the air may vary from time to time and from place to place.
Themajor pollutants present in the air are particulate matter 

(dust, soot) and gases like carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen 

dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. The 
air quality index
 (AQI) is a 

tool used to describe the air quality.

8.1.2 Types of mixtures
You know that the term ‚mixture™ in common usage refers to the 
mixing of two or more components. The components of a mixture 

may themselves be mixtures, as in 
poha
 and sprout salad, or 
pure substances like sugar or common salt dissolved in water. 

However, in science, all the components of a mixture must be 

pure substances only.
Mixtures could be of several types depending on the physical 
state of their components. Some mixtures with their examples are 

shown in Table 8.1. Complete the third columnŠ

You learnt in earlier grades about the separation of mixtures. It 

is done to separate the components of a mixture. The examples 

discussed were from everyday life, where separation is done 

to obtain the component of interest and other components are 

discarded. However, in science, the purpose of separating a  

mixture is to obtain pure substances.
8.2 What Are Pure Substances?
Have you ever noticed the word ‚pure™ written on the packs of 
some consumables, such as milk, ghee, and spices (Fig. 8.7)? The 

word ‚pure™ has slightly different meanings in common usage 

and in science.
In common usage, ‚
pure
™ means unadulterated products. 
Adulteration
 is an illegal process of adding substances which 

are cheaper, or of a poor quality, to a product. This is usually 

done to increase the quantity or reduce the manufacturing cost. 

However, it deteriorates the quality of the product. It can also 

make the product hazardous to health.

consumable items

121
In science, however, a pure substance is the one that has no 
other substance present in it. For a scientist, even these products 
that look pure can be considered 
impure
 if they are made of 

more than one substance.
A pure 
substance
 is a kindof matter that cannot be separated 
into other kinds of matter by any physical process. When a 

scientist says that something is pure, it means that the substance 

consists of the same type of particles.
According to science, how would you 
classify
 milk, packed 

fruit juice, baking soda, sugar, and soil
 
Š
 
as mixtures 
or pure 
substances?
8.3 What Are the Types of Pure Substances?
Recall the different states of water that you studied in 
Curiosity
, 

Grade
 
6. What happened when water was cooled or heated?
 
We observed that on cooling water gets converted into ice, and 

on boiling it gets converted into vapour. We can get back water 

up on heating ice or cooling water vapour. It shows that during 

these processes, the particles of water remain the same. Now, let 

us 
perform
 another activity in which we pass electricity through 
water and observe its effect.

Can these collected

Wait for a few minutes.
 
Do you observe the formation of any gas bubbles 

at both the terminals inside the test tubes?
 
Let it continue for 10Œ15 minutes.
 
Observe the volume of gas collected in each test 

tube (Fig. 8.8d).
 
Is the volume of the gas collected the same in 

both the test tubes? 
 
Remove these test tubes one-by-one carefully.  
 
Test these gases one-by-one by bringing a 

burning candle close to the mouth of the test 

tubes. 
 
What happens in each case? 
 
Which gas is present in each test tube?
To test the gases present in the two test tubes, bring a burning 
candle near the mouth of each test tube. A pop sound can be heard 

from one, indicating the presence of hydrogen gas (Fig. 8.9a). In the 

other test tube, the flame of the burning candle will glow brighter,  

confirming the presence of oxygen gas (Fig. 8.9b).

8.3.1 Elements
The two substances hydrogen and oxygen formed in Activity 8.3,  
are pure substances and are termed as 
elements
. Each element  

is made up of identical particles called atoms. These particles 

are different from the particles of any other element. Elements 

are substances that cannot be further broken down into simpler 

substances. They are the building blocks of all matter. Some other 

examples of elements are gold, silver, sulfur, carbon, etc.  
The atoms of most of the elements cannot exist 

independently. Two or more such atoms combine and 

form a stable particle of that element called a molecule. 

For example, two atoms of hydrogen combine to form 

one molecule of hydrogen. Similarly, two atoms of oxygen 

combine to form one molecule of oxygen (Fig. 8.10).
Elements can be classified into 
metals
 and 
non-metals
. 
You have already studied that gold, silver, magnesium,iron, and 

aluminium are metals, whereas carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, and 

oxygen are non-metals. Isn't it interesting to know that some 

elements like silicon and boron have intermediate properties 

between those of metals and non-metals? They are called 

metalloids
, about which you will learn in higher grades. 
 
The number of elements known at present is 118, and most of them exist  

in a solid state.
 
Eleven elements exist in a gaseous state at room temperature, all of 

which are non-metals like oxygen, helium, nitrogen, etc.
 
Only two elements are liquid at room temperatureŠmercury, which is a 

metal and bromine, which is a non-metal.  
 
Although gallium and caesium are solid elements, they become liquid at  

a temperature around 30 °C (303
 
K) and turn into liquid.

When electric current is passed through water, it breaks down into 

hydrogen and oxygen. Is this a chemical change or a physical change?

8.3.2 Compounds
Why cannot we separate hydrogen and oxygen present 
in water by physical means?
In water, the particles of hydrogen and oxygen are 
so tightly attached to each other that it is generally 

impossible to separate them apart using physical 

methods. That is why water is a compound. 
Compounds
 
are formed when different elements combine in fixed 
ratios to form something entirely new.
 

The properties of compounds are different 

from those of elements forming that 

compound. The constituent elements of 

a compound cannot be separated by any 

physical method. From
 
Activity 
8.3, we 
find that molecules of water are made of two different elements: 

hydrogen and oxygen (Fig. 8.11), combined chemically in a fixed 

ratio. The ratio of the number of atoms of hydrogen to oxygen in 

water has been found to be 2:1.
Are common salt and sugar elements or compounds? Let us 
find out.
Sodium, a soft metal, and chlorine, a hazardous gas, combine 
to form a harmless yet taste-enhancing substance that is essential 

for our lives. This substance is known as sodium chloride, which 

is made upof particles of sodium and chlorine in a 1:1 ratio. We 

learnt that dissolved sodium chloride (common salt) may be 

separated from water by the physical process of evaporation.
Is it possible to separate sodium chloride into its elements by 
physical processes? 
Let us now explore if we can separate the elements in sugar
!

 
Put a teaspoon of sugar in a boiling
 
tube. 
 
Heat it gently as shown in Fig. 8.12a.
 
What do you observe?
Oh! This is really 

fascinatingŠhydrogen is 

a fuel, oxygen supports 

combustion, whereas 

water extinguishes fire.
This activitymust be performed 

in the presence of a teacher.
More than 45 different elements, like aluminium, copper, silicon, 

cobalt, lithium, gold, silver, etc., are used in manufacturing a mobile 

phone, including its screen, battery, and other components.

As you heat the sugar, it turns brown 
(Fig.
 
8.12b). Later, it begins to char, i.e., it
 
turns blackish (Fig. 8.12c). 
You will find small droplets of water 
inside the boiling tube near its open end. 
Where did this water come from? Was 

it in the dry sugar, or did it come by the 

condensation of water vapour in the air?
Since we are heating the tube, the 
water must have come from the dry sugar 

and not from the air. Can you 
predict
 
what is left behind? Charcoal (carbon) is 

left behind in the boiling tube. You can 

scoop it out in a watch glass (Fig. 8.12c) 

and explore if it burns like coal.
Sugar decomposes on heating and 
gives carbon and water. As you know, 

water consists of hydrogen and oxygen. 

Hence, sugar cannot be an element.
 

It may be stated that sugar is a chemical 

compound consisting of the elements 

carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
Let us explore more about 

compounds.



Safety First
This activity may be demonstrated under the supervision of the 

teacher. It may be performed in a fume hood or a well-ventilated 

area. Do not inhale the gases.

Some discussion points
 
Do the Samples, A and B look the same?
 
Which sample exhibits magnetic properties?
 
Can we separate the components of Samples A and B?
 
On adding dilute hydrochloric acid, do gases evolve in both 
Samples A and B? 
 
In both the cases, do the gases smell the same or different?
 
Also, 
categorise 
the substances used in this activity into 
mixtures, compounds, and elements.
Sample A
:
 
We can say that Sample A is a mixture of the two 
elementsŠiron and sulfur. Its components retain their properties, 

and their black and yellow coloured particles can be seen.
 

On bringing magnet near Sample A, the iron filings get attracted 

towards the magnet. Hence, iron and sulfur can be separated.
You might have observed that in Sample A, iron in the mixture 
reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form iron chloride and 

hydrogen gas. The gas is colourless, has no smell, and burns with 

a ‚pop™ sound.
The reaction can be represented as
 
Š
Iron + Dilute Hydrochloric acid 
 Iron chloride + Hydrogen gas
Sulfur on the other hand, is left as a yellow solid at the bottom 
of the test tube. This shows that sulfur does not react with 
hydrochloric acid
.
Sample B
: 
The black mass obtained in Sample B is iron sulfide.
 
We observe that the texture and the colour are the same throughout.  

It is formed by heating the two elements, iron and sulfur. It is not 

attracted by a magnet. The new substance has completely different  

properties, and iron and sulfur can no longer be separated. Hence, 

we can say that a compound has been formed. Can you explain  

now why the magnet has no effect on Sample B?
Also, Sample B, iron sulfide, reacts with dilute hydrochloric 
acid, to form iron chloride and hydrogen sulfide gas. The gas is 

colourless and has a rotten egg-like odour. 
The reaction can be represented as
 
Š
Sample A
Sample B
Iron sulfide + Dilute Hydrochloric acid 
 Iron chloride + Hydrogen sulfide

How Do We Use Elements, Compounds, 
and Mixtur
es?
Elements, compounds, and mixtures are all around us. The 

air we breathe is a mixture of gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and 

carbon dioxide. Water, which is essential for life, is a compound 
Chapter 8.indd   128

made of elements, hydrogen and oxygen. Elements like iron and 
aluminium are used to construct bridges, buildings, and vehicles.
Understanding these concepts is not just about recognising 
what surrounds us; it is also the key to innovation. For instance,  

chemists study how elements combine to create compounds, 

enabling them to invent life-saving medicines and vaccines to fight  

diseases. This knowledge also helps in the creation of fertilisers 

thereby enhancing crop production that feeds the ever-increasing 

human population globally.
Engineers and material scientists rely on their understanding of 
compounds and mixtures to design materials with unique properties.  

For example, they have developed alloys like stainless steel, which is 

stronger and more durable than pure iron. Wood, steel, and concrete,  

which are used as building materials, are all mixtures.
You learnt that various metals are obtained from minerals. 
Let us learn about these minerals.
An example of a ‚wonder™ material 

developed by material scientists is graphene 

aerogel. This is made from carbon and is 

said to be the lightest material on earth. It is 

so light that even grass can hold it (Fig. 8.21). 

It is highly porous and therefore, has a high 

absorbing capacity. For this reason, it can 
potentially be used as an environmental cleaner, for example, to 

clean up oil spills in both seas and on land. It is useful in fabricating
 

energy-saving devices and special coatings for buildings.
Fig. 8.21
8.5 What Are Minerals?
Most rocks are a mixture of 
minerals
, which can be 

viewed with the eyes, or by using a magnifying glass or 

a microscope. Some of the minerals are called native 

minerals, which are pure elements and not compounds. 

These can be metals, such as gold, silver, copper, etc., or 

non-metals like sulfur, carbon, etc. 
Most of the minerals are compounds made up of more 
than one element. Some common examples of minerals 

include quartz, calcite, mica, pyroxene, and olivine 

(Fig.
 
8.22). Many 
things that we use in our everyday life are 
made up of minerals or elements extracted from minerals. 

For example, cement is made from calcite, quartz, alumina, 

and iron oxide, which are minerals or are obtained from 

minerals. Talcum powder is made from the mineral talc.

Elements and compounds are the building blocks of 
matterŠeverything that has mass and takes up space. Theymake 
the materials we see and use every day. However, not everything 

around us is matter. Light, heat, electricity, and even thoughts 

and emotions are important parts of our world, but they are not 

madeof matter. Understanding whatmatter isŠand what it is 

notŠhelps us better understand the world around us.
Use of elements, compounds, and 

mixtures in Indian Art
The Dhokra art is an old craft from Bihar and 

Odisha that uses different metals to create 

beautiful figures inspired by nature (Fig. 8.23). 

The process begins with shaping a design in 

beeswax. This wax model is covered with clay 

to make a mould.After the clay hardens, the 

wax is melted out, leaving a hollow space. This 

space is then filled with molten brass or bronze 

which makes Dhokra art strong and gives it a 

shiny golden colour. The figures often show 

animals, people, and nature, reflecting tribal 

creativity and tradition.
Fig. 8.23: Dhokra art
 
A mixture consists two or more substances mixed together. These 

substances retain their individual properties and do not react chemically 

with each other.
 
The individual substances that make up a mixture are called its 

components.
 
A pure substance consists the same type of particles. All the constituent 

particles of that substance behave identically.
 
Pure substance can be either an element or a compound. 
 
Elements are the simplest substances that cannot be broken down further 

into simpler substances. They are the building blocks of all matter. 
 
Substances which are composed of two or more elements combined 



constituent elements are called compounds.
 
Minerals are natural, solid substances found on the Earth. They have a 

 

they can also be pure elements.

Solvent
You must have taken an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) at some 
time in your life. ORS is used to treat dehydration by keeping 

your body hydrated. You have learnt to prepare ORS at home in 

Curiosity, 
Grade 6. You may have wondered why every sip of 
your homemade ORS tastes the same, no matter how much you 

drink. Why does it not taste salty in one sip and sweet in another? 
 
This is because when you add sugar and salt to water, they 
form a mixture in which the components are evenly distributed 

throughout. 
Can you 
predict
 whether this mixture is uniform or 
not (Fig. 9.1)? What happens when chalk powder is mixed 

with waterŠdoes it form a uniform mixture? 
When salt and sugar are mixed with water, a 
uniform
 
mixture
 is formed, whereas when chalk powder or sand, or 

sawdust is mixed with water, the components are not evenly 

distributed. Such mixtures are known as 
non-uniform 

mixtures
 (Fig. 9.2a and 9.2b).
Let us 
explore
 the science of mixing things together.
9.1 What Are Solute, Solvent, and Solution?
A uniform mixture, such as that of salt or sugar, and water, is 

called a solution. Whenever a solid is 

mixed with a liquid to form a solution, the 

solid component is called the 
solute
, and 

the liquid component is called the 
solvent
. 

The solute dissolves in the solvent to form 

a 
solution 
(Fig. 9.3).
Solute + Solvent 
 Solution
When a solution is formed by mixing 
two liquids, it is not always clear which 

substance is dissolving the other. In such 

cases, the substance present in smaller 

amount is called the solute, while the one 

in larger amount is called the solvent.
We know air is a 

mixture. Woulda 

mixture of gases also be 

considered a solution?
Just as water can act as a solvent in liquid solutions, gases can 
also form solution
 
Š with air being a common example.
Airis 
a gaseous solution. Since nitrogen is presen t in  t he la rgest 
amount in the air, it is considered as the solvent, while oxygen, 

argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases are considered as solutes.

The 
Chashni
 (sugar syrup) of the Indian 
sweet Gulab jamun is made of a large amount 
of sugar (solid) dissolved in a small amount 

of water (liquid). However, the water is still 

considered as the solvent and sugar as  the 

solute (Fig. 9.4)!
Fig. 9.4: Gulab jamuns

9.2  How Much Solute Can a Fixed Amount of 

Solvent Dissolve?
Activity 9.1: Let us investigate
 
Take a clean glass tumbler and fill it 

half with water.
 
Add one spoon of salt into it and stir well  

till it dissolves completely (Fig. 9.5).
 
Gradually add a spoonful of salt into the glass tumbler and 

stir. 
Observe
 how many spoons of salt you can addbefore it 
stops dissolving completely.

Some discussion points
 
How many spoons of salt were you able to dissolve before 

some of it remained undissolved?
 
What does this indicate about the capacity of water to 

dissolve salt?
What will happen if we 

keep on adding more 

salt in a given amount 

of water?

You might have observed that, initially, the salt completely 
dissolves in the water, forming a solution. After adding a few 
more spoons of salt, a stage comes when the added salt does not  

dissolve completely and the undissolved salt settles at the bottom.  

This indicates that the water can no longer dissolve any more salt 

because it has reached its limit. The solution in which more solute 

can be dissolved at a given temperature, is called an 
unsaturated  

solution
 (Fig. 9.5). However, when the solute stops dissolving and 

begins to settle at the bottom, the solution is called a 
saturated  

solution
 at that particular temperature (Fig.
 
9.6).
The 
amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution 
(or solvent) is termed as its 
concentration
. Depending upon the 

amount of solute present in a fixed quantityof solution, it can be 

called a 
dilute solution
 (less amount of solute) or a 
concentrated
 

solution
 (more amount of solute). Dilute and concentrated are  

relative terms. 
So, one can say in Activity 9.1, the solution obtained by 
dissolving one spoon of salt is dilute as compared to that obtained 

by dissolving two or more spoons of salt. 
Can you now 
Š which solution is more concentrated; 
2
 
spoons of salt in100 mL 
of water or 4 spoons of salt in 50 mL 
of water?
From Activity 9.1, we can say that the maximum amount of 
solute that dissolves in a fixed quantity of the solvent is called its 

solubility
. 
Does temperature affect the solubility of a solute?
Let us find out!

Activity 9.2: Let us experiment  

(Demonstration activity)
 
Take about 50 mL of water in a glass beaker and 
measure
 its 

temperature using a laboratory thermometer, say 20 °C.
 
Adda spoonful of baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) 

to the water and stir until it dissolves. 

Continue adding small amounts of baking 

soda while stirring, till some solid baking 

soda is left undissolved at the bottom of 

the beaker.

Now, heat the contents to 50 °C while 
stirring (Fig. 9.7). 
 
What happens to the undissolved baking 

soda? 
 
You will observe that it has dissolved.
 
Continue adding more baking soda while 

stirring at this temperature until some 

solid baking soda remains undissolved.
 
Again, heat the contents further to 70
 
°C 
whilecontinuing to stir. What 
do you 
observe?
 
The undissolved baking soda dissolves.
 
Whatdo you 
infer
 from this experiment? 
Water at 70 
°C
 dissolves more baking soda 
than water at 50 
°C
. The amount of baking 
soda dissolved in water at 20 
°C
 is even lesser.
 
It has been found that for most of 
the substances, the solubility increases with an increase in 

temperature. We can also say that a saturated solution at a 

particular temperature behaves as an unsaturated solution if the 

temperature is increased.
Water has primarily been used as a solvent for the preparation of 

medicinal formulations in Ayurveda, 
Siddha
, and other traditional 
systems of medicine in India. Additionally, drug formulations have 

been prepared using hydro-alcoholic extracts of the herbs. The 

Indian systems of medicine have also referred to the use of oils, 

ghee, milk, and other substances as solvents for drug formulations, 

to help achieve the therapeutic benefits of the drug.

Do gases also dissolve in water?
9.3  Solubility of Gases
Many gases, including oxygen, dissolve in water. Oxygen 
dissolves in water only to a small extent. Even though present 

in minute quantities, it is this dissolved oxygen that sustains 

all aquatic life, including plants, fishes, and other organisms.
Is the mixture of gases in water a uniform or non-uniform 
mixture?
It is a uniform mixture because the gases 
dissolve evenly in water to form a solution.
Does temperature affect the solubility 
of gases in liquids also? If so, how?
It has been observed that the solubility 
of gases generally decreases as temperature 

increases. More oxygen can dissolve in 

cold water, ensuring sufficient oxygen for 

aquatic life (Fig. 9.8). On the other hand, 

when water warms up, the solubility of 

oxygen decreases.
Now I understand that the mixtures we use can be 

of two typesŠuniform and non-uniform. Uniform 

mixtures are called solutions, and their components 

are not visible separately. In non-uniform mixtures, 

the components can be seen either with the naked 

eye or with a magnifying device.
I observed that in some non-uniform mixtures, such 

as sawdust in water, the sawdust floats, whereas 

in the mixture of sand and water, the sand sinks. 

I

y that happens?

9.4 Why Do Objects Float or Sink in Water?
You must have observed that some objects float while 
others sink in water (Fig. 9.9). You may have noticed that, 

while washing rice, husk particles present in the rice float 

on the surface of water while rice sinks to the bottom 

of the container. Why does thishappen? If you add oil 

to water, it floats on water. Generally, it is believed that 

objects that 
float
 in a liquid are lighter and others that 
sink
 are heavier than the liquid.
A wooden stick and an iron rod may be of the same size,  
yet the iron rod feels much heavier. When we say that iron  

is heavier than wood, we are referring to a special property  
known as density, which describes the heaviness of an object.  
Note
However, the density of a substance is not the only factor that  

decides whether it will float or sink in a particular liquid.
Let us explore further.
9.5 What Is Density?
Imagine a crowded bus where many people are packed 

together
 
Š
 
thisis an example of high 
density whereas, 
the same bus with only a few people is an example of 

low density. Similarly, a forest where trees grow close 

to each other is called a dense forest (Fig.
 
9.10a), but if 
the trees 
are far apart (Fig. 9.10b), it is considered less 
dense.
 
Let us find out.
We have learnt that matter is anythingthat possesses 
mass and occupies space (volume). 
Density
 is defined 

as the mass present in a unit volume of that substance.
The density of a substance may be expressed 
mathematically using the formula:
Density
 = 
Mass
Volume
The density of a substance is independent of its shape or size. 
However, it is dependent on temperature and pressure. Pressure 

primarily affects the density of gases, while its effect on solids 

and liquids is negligible.

while others sink in water

 Fig. 9.11: Packed oil
Think like a scientist 
Have you noticed that some packets of ghee or oil are 
labelled with a volume of 1 litre but a weight of only say 

910 grams (Fig. 9.11)? What does this tell us about the 

density of the oil, and is it less or more than that of water?
The units in which density is expressed will depend upon the 
units of mass and volume taken. As you have learnt, the 
SI units
 
of 
mass
 and 
volume 
are 
kilogram
 (
kg
) and 
cubic metre
 (
m
3
),  
respectively. Therefore, the 
SI unit 
of
 density
 is 
kilogram per cubic  
metre
, abbreviated as 
kg/m
3
. In case of liquids, other units of density 
are also used for convenience, such as gram per millilitre, abbreviated 

as g/mL and gram per cubic centimetre, abbreviated as g/cm
3
. 
Conversion factor for density
 
1 kg/m

 = 1000 g/m
3 
= 1000 g/1000 L = 1 g/L = 1 g/1000 mL =

g/1000 cm
3
The mass of 1 mL of water is close to 1 g at room temperature. 
For the measurement of the mass of water, we generally consider 

the volume in mL and its mass in g. Hence, 10
 
mL of water would 
be approximately 10 g. Similarly
, 100 mL of water would be 
approximately 100 g.
Suppose the mass of an aluminium block is 27 g and its volume 
is 10 cm
3
, its density is 2.7 g/cm
3
.
From this, it can be said that aluminium is 2.7 times denser 
than water. We express this fact by saying that the relative 

density of aluminium with respect to water is 2.7. It is a number 

without any units.

9.5.1 Determination of density 
The density of an object can be determined by measuring its 

mass and volume.
How to measure mass? 
You learnt the term ‚mass™ in 
Curiosity
, Grade 6. 
Mass
 is the 
quantity of matter present in any object. The instrument used to 

measure the mass of an object is known as a 
balance
. You must 

have seen various types of balances being used by shopkeepers. 

Here, we are using a 
digital weighing balance
 to measure the 
mass. You learnt in chapter ‚Exploring Forces™ that on Earth, 

weight and mass are closely related.

142
You may measure the mass by doing the following activity.
Activity 9.3: Let us measure
 
Switch ON the digital weighing balance.
 
Observe the initial reading on the digital weighing 
balance display. 
 
It should show a zero reading. If not, then we must 

bring it to zero by pressing the tare or reset button 

(Fig. 9.12a).
 
Place a dry and clean watch glass or butter paper 

on the pan.
 
Note the reading on the digital weighing balance.
 
Reset the digital weighing balance reading to zero 

by pressing the tare or reset buttonas shown in 

Fig.
 
9.12b.
 
Now, carefully place the solid object, such as stone, 

on the watch glass (Fig. 9.12c).
 
Note the reading displayed on the balance, which 

gives the mass of the stone, say 16.400 g.
(You may use any other type of balance available in 

your school.)

A step further
As mentioned in Chapter 5, the words ‚mass™ and 

‚weight™ are often used interchangeably in everyday  

language. But they have different meanings in  

science, which can sometimes cause confusion.  

Mass is the quantity of matter present in an object  

or a substance. Its units are gram (g) and kilogram 

(kg). On the other hand, weight is the force by which 

the Earth attracts an object or a substance towards 

itself, and it is measured in newtons (N). Most balances (except two-pan 

balances like in Fig. 9.13) actually measure weight, but their scales are marked 

in mass units, so they show values in grams or kilograms (Fig. 9.12c).

Fig. 9.15: Measuring cylinders of different 
capacities
How to measure volume?
A tetra pack says it contains 200 mL buttermilk (
chach)
 (Fig. 9.14)
. 
What does that mean?
You learnt in 
Curiosity, 
Grade 6
 
that 
volume
 is the space 
occupied by an object. You also know that the SI unit of volume 
is cubic metres, written as m³. It is the volume of a cube whose 

each side is one metre in length. Volume of smaller objects is 

conveniently expressed in a decimetre cube (dm
3
) or centimetre 
cube (cm
3
). One centimetre cube is also written as one cc. Volume 
of liquids is expressed in litres (L) which is equivalent to 1 dm
3
. 
A commonly used submultiple of a litre is millilitre (mL) which is 

equivalent to 1
 
cm
3
.  
One of the common apparatuses used to 
measure the volume of liquids is a 
measuring 

cylinder
. It is a narrow transparent cylindrical 

container with one side open and the other side 

closed as shown in Fig.
 
9.15. There are markings 
on the tr
ansparent body of the cylinder that 
indicate the volume of liquid in the measuring 

cylinder. We can use it to measure the desired 

amount of a liquid.
Measuring cylinders are available in different 
sizes to measure volume
 
Š5 
mL, 10
 
mL, 
25
 
mL, 
50
 
mL, 100 mL, 250 mL, etc (Fig.
 
9.15). How 
accur
ately can these measuring cylinders 
measure?
Let us find out!
Activity 9.4: Let us observe and calculate
In 
Curiosity
, Grade 6, chapter ‚Temperature and Its Measurement™, 
you learnt how to use the thermometer and to find its smallest 
reading; you can do the same with a measuring cylinder. 
Take a measuring cylinder and observe it carefully. Note 
down the following:
 
What is the maximum volume it can measure?
Now look at the measuring cylinder (Fig. 9.16) carefully. The 

cylinder is marked as 100 mL; therefore, it can measure volume 

up to 100 mL.
What is the smallest volume it can measure? Look at the 
measuring cylinder again.
 
How much is the volume difference indicated between the 

two bigger marks (for example, between 10 mL and 20 mL)?
Fig. 9.14: A pack of 
buttermilk of 200 mL
Chapter 9.indd   143
Chapter 9.indd   143
6/28/2025   5:06:14 PM

144
 
How many smaller divisions are there between the two 
bigger marks?
 
How much volume does one small division indicate?
The smallest volume that the measuring cylinder can read 

is__________.
For the measuring cylinder shown in 
 
Fig. 9.16, the volume difference indicated 

between 10 mL and 20 mL, or between 40
 
mL 
and 50 mL, is 10 mL.
Thenumbe
r of divisions between these 
marks is 10.
So, one small division can read 10 ÷ 10 = 1 mL.
That is, the smallest value that this measuring cylinder can 
read is 1 mL.
The smallest volume that a measuring cylinder can measure 
depends on the capacity of the measuring cylinder. Usually it is 
0.1 mL in smaller measuring cylinders with a capacity of 10 mL 

or 25 mL, it is 1 mL in a 100 mL measuring cylinder, 2 mL in a 

250 mL measuring cylinder, and 5 mL in a 500 mL measuring 

cylinder. Suppose we want to take 70 mL of water. If we use a 

50
 
mL measuring cylinder, it would 
not be possible to measure 
70
 
mL 
of water in one step. First, we have to measure 50 mL water 
and then 20 mL. Measuring volume in more than one step is not 

convenient. On the other hand, if a 250 mL or 500 mL measuring 

cylinder is used, the measurement can be done in one step but 

the accuracy would be reduced as the smallest volume that these 

measuring cylinders can measure is greater than that of a 100
 
mL 
measuring cylinder. Hence, a 100 mL measuring cylinder is the 
best choice for this measurement. 
Activity 9.5: Let us measure 50 mL of water 
 
Place a clean, dry measuring cylinder on a flat surface. 
 
Pour water slowly into the measuring cylinder up to the 
required mark, as shown in Fig. 9.17.
 
If required, adjust the level of water in the measuring 

cylinder by adding or removing a small amount of water 

using a dropper.
 
On careful observation, you will notice that the water inside 

the measuring cylinder forms a curved surface. This curved 

surface is called the 
meniscus
 (Fig. 9.18).
 
Read the mark on the measuring cylinder that coincides with 

the bottom of the meniscus for water or other colourless 
liquids.

cylinder of 100 mL
Why are measuring cylinders 

always designed narrow and 

tall instead of wider and 

short like a beaker?

Make sure that the eyes are at level with the bottom of the 
meniscus while noting the readings as shown in Fig. 9.18.

In case of coloured liquids 
the mark on the measuring 

cylinder should coincide with 

the top of the meniscus!
Determining volume of solid objects with regular 

shapes

 various objects with a cuboid shapes, such as a 

notebook, a shoe box, or a dice.
 
Measure the length (

), width (
w
), and height (
h
) of the objects 

using a scale. Suppose the length of the notebook is 25 cm, 

the width is 18 cm, and the height is 2 cm. 
 
Calculate
 the volume by using the following formula.
Volume = 
l

Volume = 25 cm × 18 cm × 2 cm = 900 cm

Record in your notebook.
Determining volume of objects with irregular shapes
Imagine you have an object, like a stone, that does not have a 

regular shape. To calculate its density, the main challenge is to 

find its volume. Let us learn how the volume of a solid with an 

irregular shape can be determined.

Tie the object, say a stone, with a thread and slowly lower it 

into the measuring cylinder.
 
What do you notice? 
 
Record the final volume after the level rises, say 55 mL, as 

shown in Fig. 9.19b.
 
Subtract the initial volumefrom the final volume after the 

object is put into the measuring cylinder. This is the volume 

of the object.

Let us dig deeper! 
Did you know that our planet, Earth, is 
composed of several layers, such as crust, 

upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and 

inner core, each withits particular range of 

density? The outermost layer, called the crust, 

is the lightest and the density of the different 

layers increases as we move towards the 

centre (Fig. 9.20). As one moves deeper into the 

Earth, both the pressure and the temperature 

rise significantly, making the materials heavier 

and more compact.
Ever heard of ...
In ancient times, before large ships 

were invented, people used bamboo 

and wooden logs to travel across 

rivers and seas (Fig. 9.21). Bamboo 

was used because it is light, hollow,  

and floats easily on water. People tied 

bamboo poles together to make rafts 

and small boats for fishing, trading,  

and crossing water bodies. Wooden  

logs, especially from strong trees were 

either hollowed out to make boats or 
used as rafts. These simple boats, made from locally ava il a bl e ma t eria l s,  

were important for moving around and connecting different places. 

Even today, similar traditional boats made of bamboo or wood are used 

in some regionsŠnot just for transport, but also as tourist attractions.
Fig. 9.21: Bamboo raft floats

Generally, the density of a substance decreases with heating and 

increases with cooling. This can be explained on the basis of 

what you have learnt in chapter ‚Particulate 

Nature of Matter™. As temperature increases, 

the particles of a substance whether, solid, 

liquid, or gas, tend to move away and 

spread. This results in an increase in volume 

but there is no change in mass. Since the 
 
Density = Mass/Volume, upon heating, the 

volume increases and the density decreases. 

This explains why hot air moves up as it is less 

dense than the cool air around it. The hot air 

balloon works on the same principle (Fig.
 
9.22).

Pressure affects density differently depending on the state of 
matter. For gases, increasing pressure causes the particles to 

move closer  together. As a result, the volume of the gas decreases 

and its density increases. In the case of liquids, pressure has a 

small effect because they are nearly incompressible. We have 

learnt in chapter ‚Particulate Nature of Matter ™ that the particles 

in solids are very close to each other. So, how is the density of 

solids affected when pressure is applied? Solids are even less 

affected by pressure than liquids, and changes in their density 

are usually negligible.
Ever heard of ...
Why does ice float on water? 

Ice floats on water because 

it is lighter than liquid water 

(Fig. 9.23). Water has a special 

property that its density 

is highest at 4 °C. It means 

water is heaviest at 4 °C.  

As the temperature drops,  

and water turns into ice a t  

0 °C, it undergoes a change 

in structureŠthe particles 

arrange themselves in a way that takes up more space. This process is 

called expansion. Because the same amount of water now occupies a 

larger volume, its density decreases. As a result, ice becomes lighter 

than liquid water and floats on its surface.
This is important for animals living in lakes and oceans because 
ice floats, it forms a layer on top, keeping the water underneath warm  

enough for fish and other creatures to survive, even in extremely 

cold weather.

A solution is said to be formed when two or more substances mix to form 
a uniform mixture.
 
In the solution formed by dissolving a solid in a liquid, the solid component 

is known as a solute and the liquid component is known as a solvent.
 
In a solution formed by mixing two liquids, the component present in less 

quantity is known as solute and the other component is called solvent. 
 
In air, nitrogen is considered as a solvent, while oxygen, argon, carbon 

dioxide, and other gases are considered as solutes.
 
A solution in which the maximum amount of solute has been dissolved, 

and no more of it can be dissolved at that temperature is called a saturated 

solution.
 
A solution in which more solute can be dissolved at a given temperature 

is called an unsaturated solution.

During the summer holidays, Meena went to a science centre with 
her family. The centre had many fascinating displays on nature, 

space, and technology. While her parents explored a section on 

saving water andelectricity, Meena andher brother wandered off 

to look around. In one corner, Meena noticed a row of unusual, 

curved mirrors. Curious, she stepped closer and looked into one. 

Her face appeared unusually large, while her brother, standing 

a little farther away, looked upside down! At another mirror, she 

saw a tiny version of herself. Meena was puzzled.
She remembered doing activities with a mirror earlier where 
the image formed by the mirror was of the same size as the object 

and was erect (in the chapter ‚Light: Shadows and Reflections™ 

in 
Curiosity
, Grade 7). Seeing her confusion, a guide from the 
science centre walked up to her andsmiled. ﬁThese are not plane 

mirrors,ﬂ the guide explained. ﬁThese are spherical mirrors. 

When the mirror is curved inward or outward, your image looks 

different in them!ﬂ Meena™s curiosity grew and she decided to 

talk to her teacher about these spherical mirrors.
10.1 What Are Spherical Mirrors?
Activity 10.1: Let us explore
 
Take a shiny metallic spoon andholdits 

curved surface close to your face. Can you 

see your image in it?
 
Notice
 the image of your face. Is it different 

from the image you see in a plane mirror? 
 
While 
observing 
the image, slowly move the 
spoon away from your face. Do you observe 

any change in the image?
 
Now flip the spoon and repeat the same steps.
Did you notice that the shiny metallic spoon acted 

like a mirror and you could see your image in it? 

When you looked at the inner side of the spoon which is curved 

inwards, you must have observed that the image was inverted 

(Fig. 10.1a). When you looked at the outer side of the spoon which 

bulges outwards, the image of your face was erect but smaller in 

size (Fig. 10.1b). 
Curvedmirrors, like the spoon, can also be specially made. 
Spherical mirrors are a common type of curved mirrors which 

are shaped like a part of a hollow glass sphere. Mirrors, whose 

reflecting surfaces are spherical are called 
spherical mirrors
.

The reflecting surface of the spherical mirror may be curved 
inwards or outwards. A spherical mirror, which has a reflecting 
surface that curves inwards, is called a 
concave mirror
 

(Fig.
 
10.2a). 
Its schematic representation is shown in Fig. 10.2b. 
The outline of the surface of the mirror is circular.

Fig. 10.3: (a) Convex mirror; 
(b) Its representation
A spherical mirror which has a reflecting surface that curves 
outwards is called a 
convex mirror
 (Fig. 10.3a). Its schematic 

representation is shown in Fig. 10.3b.
In the representation of both the mirrors, the non-reflecting 
surface of the mirror is shown as shaded.
A step further
The shape of a spherical mirror is such that it can be thought of as 

a part of an imaginary hollow sphere. However, remember that 

spherical mirrors are not made by slicing a hollow glass sphere. 

Instead, they are created by grinding and polishing a flat glass 

piece into a curved surface. If a reflective coating (like a thin layer 

of aluminium) is applied on the outer curved surface, it forms 

a concave mirror. If the coating is applied on the inner curved 

surface, it forms a convex mirror.

Activity 10.2: Let us distinguish
 
Place concave and convex mirrors on a table 
with their reflecting surfaces facing upwards. 
 
Now view them from the side, keeping your 

eye at their level, to 
identify
 whether the 

reflecting surface is curved inwards or 

outwards (Fig. 10.4).

10.2 What Are the Characteristics of Images 

Formed by Spherical Mirrors?
Activity 10.3: Let us explore
 
Take a concave mirror, a convex 

mirror, two small wooden blocks 

or something similar to place the 

mirrors in an upright position, and 

a small toy or some other object.
 
Place the two mirrors side by side 

in an upright position on a table. 

Keep the object in front of them at 

a small distance (3Œ4
 
cm awa
y) as 
shown in Fig.
 
10.5a. Whatkind 
of 
images do you see in each mirror? 

Are the images of the same size as 

the object? Are they erect? Do you 

see lateral inversion in the images? 

Write down your observations in your notebook.
 
Now slowly move the object away from the mirrors. What 

changes do you see in the images in both the mirrors? Do 

the images become smaller or larger? Do they continue to be 

erect? Again, note down your observations.
 
Repeat the steps with each mirror individually.
 
Analyse
 your observations and 
draw conclusions
.
How can we distinguish 

between concave and 

convex mirrors?

In the concave mirror, when the object is placed close to the 
mirror, the image is erect but larger than the object in size, that is,  
enlarged
. However, when the object is moved farther away, the 

image becomes inverted. Initially, the image is enlarged in size  and 

then keeps getting smaller. In case of a convex mirror, the image 

is always erect and smaller than the object, that is 
diminished
. 

However, the size of the image decreases slightly as the object is 

moved away from the convex mirror. 
Thisactivity shows that spherical mirrors (concave and 
convex) behave differently from plane mirrors. A plane mirror 

always forms an erect image of the same size as the object. 

However, in the concave and convex mirrors, the size of the 

image changes as the distance of the object from the mirror 

changes. In addition, in the case of a concave mirror, the image 

also gets inverted when the object is taken away from the mirror. 

Lateral inversion of the image is seen in all three types of mirrors. 
I just got an idea. We can also identify 

whether a mirror is plane, or concave, 

or convex by looking at the images of an 

object formed in them!
Yes. Butwhere do we 

find concave and convex 

mirrors being used in 

our surroundings?
The reflectors of torches, headlights of cars 
and scooter s are concave in shape (Fig.
 
10.6a).
Have you ever noticed a dental mirror used b
y 
a dentist for inspecting teeth? It is a concave 

mirror which provides an enlarged view of teeth 

whenheldclose to the teeth insidethe mouth 

(Fig. 10.6b). 
A step further
Do you remember learning about the use of telescope in the chapter 

‚Beyond Earth™ in 
Curiosity
,
 
Grade 6? Most modern telescopes are 
reflecting telescope that use curved mirrors, with the main mirror 

being a large concave mirror. 
Look at the side-view mirrors on vehicles. These mirrors are 
convex. They always form an erect image of the traffic behind and 

smaller than the actual vehicles. Also, since the convex mirror is

curved outside, it provides a much wider area of the road behind.  
Further, such convex mirrors are installed at road intersections 

or sharp bends to provide drivers 

from both sides the visibility of the 

other side and prevent collisions.  

Convex mirrors are also installed 

in big stores to monitor a large 

area to deter thefts.
10.3 What Are the Laws of Reflection?
Let us now repeat an activity which we did earlier in grade 7, 

but this time we will extend it further. Do you remember doing 

the activity for observing the reflection of a beam of light from a 

plane mirror?
Activity 10.4: Let us experiment
We have observed images formed by 

three types of mirrors
 
Š
 
plane,concave, 
and convex. But are there an
y laws 
which govern the image formation?
Fig. 10.8: A beam of light falling on a 
mirror (a) At one angle; 
(b) At another angle

(b)
 
Collect a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a 

comb, a paper clipto hold the comb upright, a 

sheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper.
 
As you did earlier, make a thinslit by covering 

all openings of the comb using black paper, 

except for one in the middle.
 
Spread a sheet of white paper on a table. Place 

the plane mirror upright on it.
 
Using the thin slit and torch, obtain a thin beam 

of light along the paper and adjust it to fall upon 

the mirror as shown in Fig. 10.8a.
 
Now, move the slit and torch slightly so that the 

beam of light falls at a different angle on the 

mirror (Fig.
 
10.8b). Does the 
reflected beam of 
light also shift?

Make the beam of light fall on the mirror at different angles 
and observe how the direction of the reflected beam changes.
To understand this better, let us 
draw
 this on a paper, step by 
step. But before doing that, let us learn how to represent light.
 

We often represent light by straight lines with arrows, or 
ray s
. 
Rays indicate the path along which light travels. Do you remember 

learning earlier that the light travels along a straight line?
 
Draw a line showing the position of the plane mirror.
 

Also, draw lines with arrows (rays) indicating the beam of 

lightfalling on the mirror and the reflected beam of light as 

shown in Fig. 10.9a.
The ray of light that falls on the mirror is called the 
incident 
ray
. The ray of light that comes back from the mirror is called the 
reflected ray
.
 
Now remove the mirror. From the point where the incident  

ray strikes the mirror, draw a line making an angle of 90° to the 

line representing the mirror. This line is known as the 
normal
 
to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence, O (Fig. 10.9b).
The angle between the normal and the incident ray is called 
the 
angle of incidence
 (
i
) (Fig. 10.9c). The angle between the 
normal and the reflected ray is known as the 
angle of reflection
 

(
r
) (Fig. 10.9c). 
 
On your drawing, 
measure
 the angle of incidence and the 
angle of reflection and note it in Table 10.1. 
 
Repeat the activity several times by changing the angle of 

incidence. 
 
Finally, let the incident beam fall on the mirror along the 

normal and observe the direction of the reflected beam. 

Whatwould be the angle of incidence and angle of reflection 

in this case? Both the angles would be zero in this case.
S.No. Angle of incidence (
i
 
)

r
 
)

Do you notice that both angles in Table 10.1 are nearly 
equal?If done carefully, the experiment shows that 
the angle of 
incidence (
i
) is equal to the angle of reflection (
r
)
.
 
This is a law 
of reflection.

Activity 10.5: Let us experiment
 
Use the same setup as in Activity 10.4, 
but place a stiff sheet of chart paper flat 

on a table such that part of it extends 

beyond the edge of the table.
 
Shinea beamof light on the mirror 

placed on the sheet and observe the 

reflected beam on the extended portion 

(Fig. 10.10a).
 
Now, bend the extended part of the sheet 

along the edge of the table. Do you still 

see the reflected beam on the extended 

portion?
 
Flatten the paper again and observe.
The reflected beam disappears when the 

sheet is bent but reappears when it is 

flattened again. Thisshows that the reflected 

beam lies in the same plane as that of the 

incident beam. Bending the sheet creates a 

new plane, breaking this alignment.
The incident ray, the normal to the 
mirror at the point of incidence, and the 

reflected ray, all lie in the same plane
. 

This is another law of reflection.
A step further
In the two cases, even though the directions of incident rays are 

different, they fall at the same point on the mirror, and thus, the 

directions of normal are the same. However, the direction of the 

reflected ray is such that the incident ray, the normal at the point of 

incidence, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane in both cases.

The laws of reflection are valid for all kinds of 
mirrors
 
Š
 
planeand 
spherical. Butif multiple 
parallel rays fall on the spherical mirrors, we 

observe something interesting.
Are laws of reflection 

applicable to spherical 

mirrors also?
Activity 10.6: Let us explore
 
Collect a plane mirror, a concave mirror, a convex 

mirror, stand for mirrors, a torch, a comb, and a 

paper clip to hold the comb upright.
 
Use the same setup as Activity 10.4 again, but instead 

of a single slit, leave many openings of the comb 

uncovered to obtain multiple parallel beams of light 

(Fig. 10.11a).
 
Let the multiple parallel beams of light fall upon the 

plane mirror, concave mirror, and convex mirror, 

one by one. Observe the reflected beams. Is your 

observation similar to what is shown in Fig. 10.11 

(b), (c), and (d)?
When multiple parallel beams of light fall upon a plane 
mirror, the multiple reflected beams are also parallel 

(Fig.
 
10.11b). However, when 
multiple beams of light fall 
upon a concave mirror, the multiplereflected beams get 

closer, that is, they 
converge
 (Fig. 10.11c). Whereas, in 

the case of a convex mirror, the multiple reflected beams 

spread, that is, they 
diverge
 (Fig. 10.11d). 
In the case of spherical mirrors, even though each 
ray of light follows the laws of reflection, the curved 

surface of spherical mirrors causes the parallel beam of 

rays to either converge (concave) or diverge (convex) on 

reflection depending on the shape of the mirror.
A step further
If we draw what we observed in Activity 10.6, we get the 

figures like those shown below.

161
So, the concave mirror 
converges a light beam 

while the convex mirror 

diverges it. This is indeed 

interesting!
Since the concave 

mirror converges the 

light beam, wouldn™t 

light get concentrated 

in a small area?
Activity 10.7: Let us explore
Safety First
Always perform this activity under the supervision of a teacher or 

an adult. Do not look towards the Sunor into the mirror reflecting 

the Sun. Focus the reflected light only on a piece of paper, not 

towards anyone™s face or eyes.
 
Take a concave mirror and a sheet of thinpaper 

or newspaper. 
 
Hold the concave mirror with its reflecting surface 

facing the Sun. Direct the light of the Sun reflected 

by the mirror on the sheet of paper. 
 
Adjust the distance of the paper until you get a 

sharp bright spot on it as shown in Fig. 10.12. 
 
Hold the mirror and the sheet of paper steady 

for a few minutes. Does the paper start to burn 

producing smoke?
The bright spot is formed on the paper because light from the 
Sun, after reflection from the mirror, gets concentrated on this 

point. This produces sufficient heat at this point which can ignite 

the paper.
A step further
Devices which concentrate sunlight into a small area, using mirrors 

and lenses, are called solar concentrators. The concentrated sunlight 

is used to heat a liquid to produce steam which can be used to 

generate electricity or for providing heat for various purposes, such 

as large scale cooking or for solar furnaces. Solar furnaces are even 

used for melting steel! Do you remember learning in an earlier 

chapter, about electric furnaces for melting steel?

We explored the images of an 
object formed by curved mirrors. 

But how do objects look when 

viewed through transparent 

materials with curved surfaces?
10.4 What Is a Lens?
Imagine looking through a flat 

transparent glass window pane
 
Š
 
all 
objects look the same size and shape. 

But 
would those objects continue to 
look the same if the surface of the 

transparent material is curved?
Activity 10.8: Let us explore
 
Collect a flat strip of glass or clear plastic, such as a flat scale, 

few drops of oil, dropper, water, and a paper or book with 

some text printed on it.
 
Spread a few drops of oil on the surface of glass or plastic 

strip and rub it to leave a very thin coating. You can also use 

wax instead of oil.
 
Using a dropper or your finger, place a small drop of water 

on the oiled/waxed spot. (The oil/wax helps the water form a 

nice round drop.) 
 
Examine
 the water drop. What is the shape of its surface? Is 

it flat or curved inward or curved outward?
 
Place the paper underneath the glass/plastic strip such that 

the text is directly under the water drop (see Fig. 10.13).
 
Now, look down through the water drop at the text below. Do 

you find some change in the size of the letters just below the 

water drop? Do they look enlarged or smaller?
Thesurface of the water drop is curved outside. The letters 
under the water drop look different
 
Š they might appear larger 
than the letters nearb
y! The curved surface of the water drop 
made the size of the text look different. This curved drop of water 

is acting like a simple lens. Have you seen a magnifying glass as 

shown in Fig. 10.14? It is also a lens that helps in reading small 

print by making the letters appear bigger.
A 
lens
 is a piece of transparent material, 
usually made of glass or plastic, which has 

curved surfaces. Like mirrors, lenses can also 

be convex or concave. 
A lens which is thicker at the middle as 
compared to the edges is called a 
convex lens
 

(Fig. 10.15a).

163
A lens which is thicker at the edges as 
compared to the middle is called a 
concave 
lens
 (Fig. 10.16b).
Unlike mirrors, lenses allow light to pass 
through them, and we see things through a 

lens rather than in a lens.
What changes can be seen in the 

objects when viewed through lenses?
Activity 10.9: Let us experiment
 
Collect a convex lens, a concave lens, a lens holder, and a 

small object.
 
Take the convex lens and place it upright using its holder. 
 
Place the object behind the convex lens (it may also be placed 

on something to bring it up to the level of the lens).
 
Look at the object throughthe lens from the other side of 

the lens (Fig. 10.17a) andnote your observations in your 

notebook. 
 
Now slowly move the object farther from the lens and keep 

observing how the image changes. How does the distance of 

the object from the convex lens affect how it looks?
 
Now repeat the steps using a concave lens.
 
Analyse your observations recorded in your notebook 

and 
compare
 the images seen through both lenses.
 
What conclusions do you draw?
Whenan object is placed behind a convex lens at a small 
distance from it and seen through the lens, the object appears 

erect and enlarged in size. As the distance between the object 

and the convex lens increases, the object appears inverted. It is 

initially enlarged in size and then diminishes in size. An object 

placed behind a concave lens and seen through the lens, always 

appears erect and diminished in size. Its size changes, as its 

distance from the lens increases.
Do lenses also converge or 

diverge the light beam?

Since convex lens converges a light 
beam, can it also burn a paper?
Activity 10.10: Let us investigate
 
Collect a thin transparent glass plate, a convex lens, a concave 

lens, a torch and a comb to obtain multiple parallel beams of 

light, a paper clip to hold the comb upright, two identical 

books, and sheets of white paper.
 
Using two books placed adjacent to each other, fix the glass 

plate or lens upright in between them as shown in Fig. 10.18. 

Spread paper sheets on both books.
 
Now let the multiple parallel beams of light fall upon the 

thin glass plate, convex lens, andconcave lens one by one 

as shown in Fig. 10.18. Does the parallel beam of light pass 

through as it is in all three cases?
 
Record
 and analyse your observations.
The light beam passes through the thin glass plate as it is.
 
The convex lens converges the light falling on it whilethe concave 

lens diverges the light. A convex lens is also called a 
converging 
lens
 while a concave lens is called a 
diverging lens
.

Activity 10.11: Let us investigate
 
Repeat Activity 10.7 by putting 
a convex lens in the path of 

sunrays in place of a concave 

mirror. Could you burn the 

paper?
Where all are the 

lenses used?
 
Lenses are important and are used 
everywhere around us. The eyeglasses that 

people wear to help them see clearly are 

lenses! Cameras, telescopes, and 

microscopes all use lenses to work. 

Even our eye has a convex lens 

inside it. It is quite an amazing lens 

that can change its shape, which is 

what allows us to read a book or see 

something far away.
 
Image formed by a concave mirror can be enlarged, diminished or of the 

same size as the object, and it may be erect or inverted, dependingupon 

the distance of the object from the mirror.
 
Image formed by a convex mirror is always erect and diminished in size.

Harnessing sunlight is key to 

solving future energy challenges. 

In devices like solar cookers 

(Fig. 10.29), mirrors are used to 

converge sunlight and generate 

heat. In India, such designs are used 

in villages, thus saving electricity 

and reducing fossil fuel use. Think 

of a design for a solar cooker for 

your school or home and prepare 

a detailed proposal for it including 

the budget required.

reflected images through tubes placed at appropriate angles, they 

could measure the positions of stars and planets in the sky. Even 

though the laws of reflection are not mentioned in literature, their 

instruments and methods indicate that they might have understood 

it in practice!

It was Makar Sankranti, and Meera was in Ahmedabad for the 
Patang Mahotsav
, the International Kite Festival. As she looked 

up at the sky filled with colourful kites, she noticed the Moon 

shining during the daytime. She was surprised as she had always 

thought the Moon appeared only at night. Also, the Moon did 

not appear like a full circle, but that didn™t surprise her as much. 

She knew its shape changed every night. Still, it got her thinking. 

She remembered learning that the Moon is spherical and shines 

by reflecting sunlight. Then why isn™t the whole Moon visible 

every night? For a moment, she wondered if it was due to a 

lunar eclipse. But eclipses are rare and brief. So, what causes the 

Moon™s changing shape?


Let us carefully 
watch
 the Moon to 
understand
 how its 
appearance changes over a month. You may have done a similar 

activity earlier, but let us now do it in more detail. Begin this 

activity from the sunrise after a full Moon day, that is when it is 

easiest to spot the Moon in the sky.
Activity 11.1: Let us explore
*
 
Spot
 the Moon at sunrise in the western direction on the first 

day after the full Moon.
 
Make a table similar to Table 11.1 in your notebook. Document 

the following:
 
Date
 
When you saw the Moon (at sunrise or sunset)?
 
Shade the corresponding Circle with pencil to show the 

bright portion of the Moon as shown in Fig. 11.1.
 
From the second day onwards also document the following.
 
Is the size of bright portion of the Moon increasing or 

decreasing from the previous day.
 
Whether the Moon appears closer to or farther from the 

Sun in the sky than the day before.
 
After about 15 days, you may not be able to see the Moon at 

sunrise or sunset. For the next 15 days, carry out this activity 

at sunset.

Analyse
 the data recorded by you in Table 11.1. Did the Moon 
appear different each day? Was the Moon visible on all days? 
Did the Moon appear at the same position in the sky as on the 

previous day? 
11.1.1 Phases of the Moon
You may have observed that the 

brightportion of the Moon decreases 

from a full circle to a half circle 

in about a week, as shown in 
 
Fig. 11.2. The bright portion continues 

to shrink for another week until it 

is no longer visible. This two-week 

period is called the 
waning
 period of 
the Moon. Different names are given 

to the Moon™s visible shapes during 

this cycle (Fig. 11.2). The day when 

the Moon appears as a full bright 

circle is called the 
full Moon
 day (or 

Purnima
), and the day when it is not 

visible is called the 
newMoon
 day 
(or 
Amavasya
).
After the new Moon, its bright side 
grows to a half circle in about a week  

and to a full circle (full Moon) in another 

week. The period when the bright part  

of the Moon increases is called the

waxing
 period. In India, the waning period of the Moon is generally  
called the 
Krishna Paksha
, while the waxing period is called the 

Shukla Paksha
. The Moon goes through a waning period followed by  

a waxing period in a cyclical manner as shown in Fig. 11.2. The cycle 

from one full Moon to the next takes about a month.
The changing shapes of the bright portion of the Moon from 
one day to another as seen from the Earth are called the 
phases 

of the Moon
.
11.1.2 Locating the Moon
When you checked the Moon at the same time on successive 

days (for example, at sunrise), did you see it in a different part 

of the sky? On a full Moon day, the Moon is nearly opposite the 

Sun
 
Š
 
whenthe 
Sun rises in the East, the Moon is almost setting 
in the West. On subsequent mornings at sunrise, as its bright 

part continues to decrease, the Moon appears to move closer in 

the sky to the Sun. When the bright part of the Moon decreases 

to a half circle shape, the Moon is overhead at Sunrise. A few 

days later, the crescent Moon appears even closer to the Sun. 
 
Knowing the phase of the Moon and whether it is waxing or 

waning can thus help us find out where and when to look for 

the Moon on any given day. A waxing Moon is easiest to spot at 

sunset, and a waning Moon at sunrise. Because of these shifts, 

the Moon always rises and sets at different times than the Sun.
A step further
Many people believe the Moon rises when the Sun sets, but that 

is not always true. Look in a local newspaper or on the Positional 

Astronomy Centre (India Meteorological Department) website to find 

the moonrise time in your area. Check these times for several days 

in a row and you will see that the Moon rises about 50
 
minutes later 
each day
. Sometimes moonrise happens in the afternoon (around 
2:00
 
Œ
 
4:00
 
p.m.),so you 
can spot the Moon in the eastern sky during 
daylight. You may need to waitabout 30
 
minutespast 
the listed 
moonrise time for the Moon to climb high enough for it to be seen.
The time and position of moonrise changes from one day to the next.

11.1.3 Making sense of our observations
The shape of the Moon itself does not change, only what 
we see changes. You may recall learning earlier that the 

Moon does not emit light of its own, but shines because it 

reflects sunlight that falls on it. The half of the Moon that  

faces the Sun receives sunlight and becomes illuminated 

(Fig.
 
11.3). The 
other half facing away from the Sun does 
not receive sunlight and remains non-illuminated.
The Moon revolves around the Earth and, only one 
half of the Moon always faces the Earth. However, the 

portion of the Moon facing the Earth is not always its 

illuminatedpart. We can only see the illuminatedportion 
of the Moon from Earth. Sometimes, the entire illuminated portion 

of the Moon faces the Earth, and at other times only a part of it. 

At such times the illuminated portion of the Moon that we see is 

not a full circle. On New Moon day, we do not see the illuminated 

portion of the Moon at all, as only the non-illuminated portion of 

the Moon faces the Earth. Therefore, the Moon appears different 
on different days.
Let us do an activity to understand how the 
illuminated portion of the Moon, as seen by us, 

changes when its position changes with respect 
to the Sun.
Activity 11.2: Let us explore
 
Take a small soft ball and insert a stick into it (Fig. 11.4a). 
This represents the Moon.
 
Go to a dark open place (at night), and ask a teacher or 

guardian to shine a torchlight towards you from about
 

3 m to represent light coming from the Sun or stand near an 

electric lamp. Your head represents the Earth.
 
Now hold the ball at arm™s length in one hand such that it is 

slightly above your head as shown in Fig. 11.4b. Keep the ball at  

position E towards the direction of the lamp. Does the portion  

of the ball facing you appear to be illuminated or not?
 
Turnaround slowly, in the anti-clockwise direction, with your 

arm outstretched as shown in Fig. 11.4b and keep looking at 

the ball. Does the shape of the illuminatedportion change? 

Is the line separating the illuminated and non-illuminated 

portions of the ball curved?
 
Was your observation similar to the changing shape of the 

illuminated portion of ball shown in Fig. 11.4c? The shape of 

the illuminated portion of the ball, as seen by you, changes 
depending on where the ball is with respect to the lamp.

when it appears closer 

to the Sun?

When the ball is heldopposite to the direction of the lamp 
(at
 
A), you are facing the entire 
illuminated portion of the ball, 
just like the full Moon day. On the other hand, when the ball 
is held towards the direction of the lamp (at E), you are facing 

the non-illuminated portion of the ball, and cannot see the 

illuminatedportion of the ball at all. This is similar to the new 

Moon day. Notice how in other cases, the line separating the 

illuminatedand non-illuminated portions of the ball appears 

curved (Fig.
 
11.4c), similarto 
the shape of the illuminated portion 
of the Moon viewed from the Earth on other days.
Using our observations of Activity 11.2, let us now try to 
understand the phases of Moon. Fig. 11.5a shows the positions of 

the Moon corresponding to the different positions of the ball in 

Fig.11.4b. Also shown are the Earth and the sunrays. As shown 

in Fig. 11.5a, the Moon revolves once around the Earth from 

position A to H and back to position A in about one month. The 

side of the Moon that faces the Sun is illuminated.

The portion of the Moon that faces the Earth is marked by the 
orange dashed lines and arrows. The illuminated portion of only 
this part of the Moon can be seen from the Earth. At positions 

B and H, more than half of the illuminated portion, called the 

gibbous phase
, can be seen. At positions D and F, less than half 

of the illuminated portion, called the 
crescent phase
,
 
can be 
seen. The change in the fraction of the illuminated portion of the 

Moon seen from Earth causes phases of the Moon. 
The phases that will be seen from the Earth at different 
positions of the Moon are shown in Fig. 11.5b. From A to C to E, 

we see the waning phase, and from E to G and back to A, we 

see the waxing phase. Since the rotation period of the Earth of 

one day is much smaller compared to the revolution period of 

the Moon which is nearly a month, on a given day, people on 

different parts of the Earth see nearly the same phase.
As can be seen in Fig. 11.5a, on the New Moon day, the Moon 
appears closest to the Sun and it appears farthest on the Full 

Moon day. Is this not what we also observed in Activity 11.1?

In Activity 11.1, we 
also observed that the 
position of the Moon 

at sunrise (or sunset) 

appeared to be shifted 

on successive days. 

This happens because, 

as shown in Fig. 11.6, 

the Moon moves ahead 

in its orbit while the 

Earth completes one 

rotation about its axis 

in 24 hours. Earth 

needs to rotate some 

more for the Moon to 

appear in nearly the 

same spot in the sky.
A step further
The Moon phases do not happen due to Earth™s shadow. It is an incorrect 

explanation for the Moon™s phases that Earth™s shadow falls on it. As we 

have learnt, the phases of the Moon occur due to the relative change in 

orientation of the Sun, Moon, and Earth as the Moon revolves around 

the Earth. The Earth™s shadowon the Moon causes a lunar eclipse, not 

the Moon™s phases as we learnt earlier (in chapter ‚Earth, Moon and the 

Sun™ in the 
Curiosity
,
 
Grade 7). 
Lunar eclipses can only happen on a full Moon day and solar eclipses 
can happen only on a new Moon day. But they do not occur every month 

because of the small tilt of the Moon™s orbit withrespect to the Earth™s 

orbit around the Sun.

We have learnt earlier that when viewed from the Earth, the Sun  
appears to rise in the eastward direction, set in the westward 

direction every day, and rise again the next day. This apparent 

periodic motion of the Sun seen by us is primarily due to the 

rotation of the Earth around its own axis. This natural cycle of 

the Sun due to the rotation of the Earth, is the foundation of the 

day, a unit to measure time.
The average time that the Sun takes to go from its highest 
position in the sky on one day to the highest position in the 

sky the next day, is 24 hours, and is called the 
mean solar 

day
. The highest position of the Sun in the sky can be found by 
measuring the length of the shadows cast by an object during 

the day. The shadow is shortest when the Sun is at the highest 

point in the
 
sky
. 
Activity 11.3: Let us measure a day!
 
Find a small flat area in a ground which receives sunlight 

during the day. Fix a 1 m stick vertically in it as shown in 

Fig.
 
11.7. 
 
Start observing at 11:00 a.m. Every 

minute, mark a dot on the ground 

at the tip of the stick™s shadow. Keep 

marking dots until around 1:10 p.m.
 
Identify
 when the shadow was 

shortest and find out its time by 

counting the number of dots. 
Record
 
this time in Table 11.2. Repeat this 

exercise for the next few days.
 
Find the duration of the solar day 

by finding a difference in time on 

two consecutive days as shown in 

Table
 
11.1.
So, changing phases of the 

Moon is a natural periodic 

event, with a cycle of almost 

a month, which can also be 

used for time keeping.
Yes, along with the natural periodic 

events of day and night and the 

changing seasons about which we 

learnt earlier. But how are these 

periodic events used for keeping time?

The 
phases of the Moon give us 
another natural cycle with a duration 
that is longer than a day. The Moon 

takes about 29.5
 
da
ys (nearly a month) 
to cycle through all its phases. The 

cycle of the phases of the Moon is the 

basis for a 
month
, another unit to 
measure time (Fig. 11.8).
The next larger unit to measure 
time is related to the natural cycle of 

seasons. Do you remember learning 

earlier that the Earth revolves 

around the Sun and takes nearly 365 

and a quarter days to complete one 

revolution around the Sun?TheEarth 

undergoes one cycle of seasons during 

this time, whichcan be used to define 

a 
solar year
 (Fig. 11.8).
11.2.1 Lunar calendars
In ancient times, people had noticed that during one cycle of 

seasons, one can fit nearly 12 cycles of the phases of the moon,  

that is, 12 lunar months. This is how 
lunar
 
calendars 
came 
into being, with the day as the shortest unit, a month of nearly 
 
29.5 days, and a lunar year consisting of 12 lunar months. The 

phases of the Moon thus gave an easy and a perfectly sound way  

to track the passage of time.
However, in a lunar calendar the seasons do not remain 
synchronised to the same lunar months insuccessive lunar years. 

The reason is that the seasons repeat in approximately 365
 
da
ys 
while the lunar year is 354 days long.

11.2.2 Solar calendars
It was important to know the arrival of seasons for agricultural  
purposes. This need for a year to synchronise with seasons led to 

the creation of 
solar
 
calendars
.
 
The Gregorian calendar, widely  
used today, is a solar calendar. The months in solar calendars are 

adjusted to add up to 365 days. That is why in Gregorian calendars,  

some months have 30 days, others 31, and February has only 

28
 
da
ys.
On top of the 365 days, the Earth takes nearly an extra quarter 
of a day to complete one revolution around the Sun. These extra 

hours add up to approximately one day every four years. To 

adjust for this, solar calendars add an extra day every four years 

using the concept of a 
leap year
. In the Gregorian calendar, if a 
year is divisible by four, then an extra leap day is added. So in a 

leap year, February has 29 days, which keeps the calendar well 

synchronised with the seasons.
A step further
The Earth takes slightly less time than 365 and a quarter day to 

go from one spring equinox to the next spring equinox. Adding a 

day every four years helps to synchronise with the seasons, but 

it actually adds a little too much over time. To fix this, leap years 

are skipped every 100 yearsŠlike in 1700, 1800, and 1900. But 

skipping all of them would make the calendar lag slightly behind. 

So every 400 years, a leap year is again added backŠlike in 1600 

and 2000. These careful corrections keep the calendar closely 

matched with the seasons over long periods of time!
A step further
As we learnt earlier, seasons are caused by the Earth™s revolution 

around the Sun and its movement from the spring equinox to 

winter equinox and back. The time between successive spring 

equinoxes is called the tropical year. Gregorian calendar is based 

upon tropical year.
We have also learnt earlier that the stars that rise at sunset 
change throughout the year due to the Earth™s revolution around 

the Sun. The time duration required for the same stars to rise 

again at sunset is called the sidereal year, and it can also be used to 



year by a mere 20 minutes, and so it takes a long time before 

the differences between the two calendars become noticeable. 
 
In modern times, astronomers use the sidereal year to keep track of 

the Earth™s position in its orbit around the Sun.

11.2.3 Luni-solar calendars
There is another kindof calendar which primarilyuses the Moon™s 
phases for counting days and months but also make adjustments 

to stay in sync with the cycle of seasons.
The 12 lunar months add up to 354 days and thus fall short by 
nearly 11 days compared to the solar year. Thus every 2Œ3 years, 
For thousands of years, people
 
Š
 
including those in India
 
Š
 
have been 
observing thesky 
and developing calendars. People in ancient times did not 
know that Earth revolves around the Sun, and lacked modern instruments. 
Yet through years of careful sky observations, they noticed patterns and cycles 

in natural events. Hence, they could 

determine that the length of the year 

was approximately 365 days allowing 

them to create calendars. 
For example, careful observation 
reveals that the Sun does not always 

rise exactly in the East. In summer, 

it rises a little northward of East 

and in winter a little southward of 

East. These extremes happen on 

the solstices, around June 21 and 

December 21 each year. The Sun™s 

apparent northward movement from December to June is called 
Uttarayan
, 
and its apparent southward movement from June to December is 
Dakshinayan
. 
This cycle repeats every year and is closely linked to the changing seasons. The 


 records it in the verse 6.5.3:



ﬁThusthe Sun moves southwards for six months and northwards for six 

months.ﬂ 
In the past, the equinoxes and solstices were also tracked by identifying the 
stars that rose at sunset. Ancient Indian texts like the 
Surya Siddhanta
 noted 
that the pattern of stars, Capricorn (called 
Makar
 in India), would be in the 

background of the Sun around the winter solstice during those ancient times.




 
Translation: From the moment of the Sun™s entrance into the constellation 

of Capricorn, six months make up its northward progress (
Uttarayana
), so 

likewise from the moment of entrance into the constellation of Cancer, six 

months are its southward progress (
Dakshinayana
).

time and celebrating festivals.

the accumulated difference becomes close to a full month. 
Therefore, every few years, an extra month (called 
Adhika Maasa
 

or intercalary month) is added to the year in some calendars. This 

keeps the solar year and the lunar cycle in step. Suchcalendars 

are called 
luni-solar calendars
. They combine elements from 

both the solar and the lunar calendars and are used in many 
parts of India.

Fig. 11.9: Indian National Calendar 
It is a solar calendar (Fig. 11.9) consisting of 365 days in a year. 
The year begins on 22 March, which is the day after the spring 

equinox. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, months in the Indian 

National Calendar have either 30 or 31 days. The names of these 

months were taken from traditional Indian calendars. In a regular 

year, the second to sixth months have 31 days and the rest have 

30 days. The leap years are matched to the Gregorian calendar by 

adding a day to Chaitra, the first month of the year. In such years, 

the new year begins on 21 March of the Gregorian calendar.

In 1952, the Government of India set up a Calendar Reform 
Committee (CRC) to examine all existing calendars which were 

being followed in the country at that time and to recommend an  

accurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India. The CRC 

recommended ‚Unified National Calendar ™ was adopted for use 

with effect from 21 March 1956 CE, that is, 1 Chaitra 1878 Saka.
 
The Indian National Calendar follows the general principles as that 

of the 
Surya Siddhanta
.

as the Saha equation. The Saha Institute of Nuclear

the chairperson of the Calendar Reform Committee.


Many Indian festivals are tied to the phases 

of the Moon and hence are based on either 

lunar or luni-solar calendars. For instance, 

Diwali
 falls on the new Moon of the month of 

Kartika
, 
Holi
 on the full Moon of 
Phalguna, 
Buddha Purnima
 on the full Moon of 
Vaisakha, Eid-ul-Fitr
 is 

celebrated after sighting the crescent Moon at the end of the 

month of 
Ramazan
, while 
Dussehra
 is celebrated on the tenth 

day in the month of 
Ashwina
. 
Hence, they occur on different dates 
in the Gregorian calendar in successive years.
For festivals based on luni-solar calendars, the Gregorian 
calendar dates can shift, but this shift is typically less than 
a month. This is because the luni-solar calendars add the 

intercalary month every few years which correct for the 

difference between the lunar and the solar year. 
In contrast, 
purely lunar calendars do not account for this difference.
 
Any festival celebrated according to the phases of the Moon, 

such as 
Eid-ul-fitr
, therefore can occur in different 
months of 
the Gregorian calendar year after year.
Why do most Indian 
festivals fall on different 

dates every year?

A few festivals in India, like 
Makar Sankranti
, 
Pongal
, 
Bihu
, 
Vaisakhi
, 
Poila Baisakh
, and 
Puthandu
, follow a solar sidereal calendar. 
These festivals happen on almost the same date every year in the 
Gregorian calendar which is based on the tropical year.
A long time ago, these festivals were tied to either a solstice or 
an equinox.Due to the small difference in the sidereal and tropical 

years, the dates of these festivals slowly shift away from the 

solstices/equinoxes. This shift is due to slow wobble of the Earth™s 

axis, similar to the movement of the axis of a wobbling top. 
This causes the dates of festivals based on the sidereal calendar 
to move ahead in tropical calendar. For example, 
Makar Sankranti
 
moves ahead by one day every 71 years.
Ever heard of ...
The dates of many Indian festivals are based on the exact lunar 

phase at sunrise. As sunrise occurs earlier in Eastern India and 

later in Western India, these dates can also shift by a day between 

these regions even in the same year. To maintain uniformity 

throughout the country, the Positional Astronomy Center of the 

Government of India annually publishesthe Rashtriya panchang, 

a detailed calculation of the positions of celestial objects, such as

these calculations, it provides an advance intimation on dates of

When I look at the night 
sky in early evening, I 

see some moving stars. 

What are they? Is their 

motion also periodic?



The Moon is Earth™s natural satellite, orbiting 

our planet. Besides the Moon, man-made 

satellites sent by various countries also orbit 

the Earth. These 
artificial satellites
 appear as 
tiny specks moving in the night sky. Most orbit 

about 800
 
km above Earth™s surface and tak
e 
roughly 100
 
minutes to complete one orbit.
These satellites 
help us in many ways like communication, 
navigation, weather monitoring, disaster management, and 

scientific research. The Indian Space Research Organisation
 
(ISR
O) 
has launched many satellites that support these activities.
The Cartosat series of satellites, launched by ISRO, capture high-quality 

images of the Earth to improve maps,plan cities, and handle natural 

disasters in India. One such mapping platform, Bhuvan, uses these 

images to show terrain, soil, land use, vegetation, and more.

Chandrayaan 1, 2, and 3 to the Moon; Aditya L1 to study the Sun; and 

Mangalyaan to Mars. ISRO also lets Indian students build and launch 

small satellites, such as AzaadiSat, InspireSat-1, and Jugnu.

To identify satellites in the sky, look for any moving object 
in the sky that appears as a point of light with steady or 

flickering brightness and is moving very fast across the sky. 

You can see them with the naked eye or with binoculars.
 
You may use mobile apps or websites that provide details 

of satellites visible in your location and when they will be 

passing above you in the sky.
A step further
A lot of artificial satellites are being sent up in space by many 

countries. After their useful life, many of them and their rocket 

parts become space junk or space debris. This debris crowds space, 

and could collide with working satellites. While small debris burns 

up in the atmosphere when it falls towards the Earth, the larger 

pieces can crash on ground. Countries are now working together to 

remove this dangerous debris.

Collect Gregorian calendars (the regular calendar you use 

every day) for the last five years with the help of your family 

members or teachers or the internet. For each year, look for 

the dates on which the festivals 
Eid-ul-Fitr
 and 
Diwali
 were 
celebrated and list them year wise in a tabular form. Do you 

notice that the date of 
Eid-ul-Fitr
 moves earlier each year
 
Š 
by 
about 11 days? If you have a corresponding lunar calendar 
at home or on the internet, 
check
 that the month and the 

day for 
Eid-ul-Fitr
 according to the lunar calendar remains 

the same. Does 
Diwali
 follow the same steady pattern, or 
are there some sudden jumps? Based on your chart, try to 

guess which year might have included an intercalary month

If you visit a place near the sea, you may notice that water levels 

rise and fall. The rise and fall of water levels are called tides. Tides 

also follow a regular pattern. If there™s a low or a high tide at a 

certain time on one day, a similar tide will come about 50 minutes 

later the next day. We also learnt that the Moon also rises about 

50 minutes later each day. Careful observations show that tide 

levels are closely related to the Moon™s position and phase.

In several parts of India, particularly in states like Odisha, 
Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam, and Chhattisgarh, elephants 

often enter farms andvillages. 
When vegetation is scarce and 
waterholes dry up in their natural habitat, elephants may wander 

in to nearby farms or plantations in search of food like bananas 

and sugarcane. This can lead to in crop damage and at times, even 

harm people and domestic animals. 
Changes in rainfall and temperature affect vegetation. Cutting 
down trees for constructing roads and buildings makes it worse. 

This leads to the shrinking and drying of forests, the natural home 

of animals. When forests cannot support wildlife, animals tend to 

move into human habitats. Elephants are adapted to forest life, 

but sudden changes make it hard for them to survive. Wildlife 

ecologists have identified  and marked corridors in many parts of 

the country to allow safe movement of animals. These corridors 

correct forest habitats, enabling wildlifeŠsuch as elephants to 

travel in need between large forest areas without coming into 

conflict with human settlements.
Thischain of events shows how closely nature™s elements are 
connected. To understand such interconnections, we must study 

the components of our environment.
12.1 
 
How 
Do W
e Experience and Interpret 
Our Surroundings?
You have learnt in 
Curiosity
, Grade 6 chapter ‚Diversity in the 

Living World™ that different habitats have different kinds of plants 

and animals. A habitatis simply place where an organism lives. 

It could even be just the bark of a tree. The plants and animals 

interact with each other and adapt to survive in the surrounding 

conditions they live in. 
Explore
 two nearby habitats and 
identify 
both the living organisms and the non-living components in each.
Activity 12.1: Let us explore
Caution
: Explore the habitat in groups with your teacher.
 
Identify two habitats in your surroundings. 
 
These could be any two of the following: a pond,a forest, an 

agricultural farm, or even a large tree like banyan, mango, 

or 
pilkhan
 (white fig) tree.
 
List the living beings and non-living things that you 
observe
 
in these habitats.
 
Record
 your observations in Table 12.1.

What common characteristics do 
you observe in the two habitatsin 
Activity 12.1? The similarities are that 

both habitats have living beings as 

well as non-living things. However, 

the types of living beings are different 

and the non-living things also vary. 

The living beings you have recorded 

in Table 12.1 are termed as the 

biotic 
components and non-living 
things as the 
abiotic
 components of 

a habitat. Have you wondered why 

some organisms live on land while 

others live in water? Every organism 

needs specific conditions to survive. 

From this activity, you can see that 

different habitats offer different 

living conditions.
In Activity 12.1, you listed fish as 
a biotic component of the pond. How 

do fish survive in a pond? A pond 

provides food, oxygen, shelter, and 

space to grow
 
Š
 
conditions essential 
for survival of organisms. Fishobtain 

their 
bioticneeds, such as food, from 
small plants and animals, and abiotic 

needs, such as oxygen, from water.
Other living beings also inhabit the pond, such as frogs, fresh 
turtles, snakes, dragonflies, mosquitos, snails, and ducks, along 

with plants like algae, diatoms, duckweeds, and lotus. They all 

interact with the other living beings and non-living things present 

in the places where they grow and thrive.

193
Each habitat has its own biotic components and physical 
conditions
 
Š
 
air, sunlight, water, temperature, and soil.
 
Different organisms living in the same habitat may use the 
resources in  different ways. A forest might be warm during 

the day and cool at night. A snake that comes out at night and a  

rodent active during the day both live in the same habitat, but they  

face different conditions. This is how living organisms coexist in  

harmony in the same habitat.
12.2 Who All Live Together in Nature? 
You have observed fish in a pond in Activity 12.1. Did you see 

only a single fish?Most likely, you may have seen many fish of 

the same kind. This group of fish of the same kind living together 

in a pond habitat is called a 
population 
of that particular fish. 
In this way, we can observe and record populationsof different 

kinds of organisms in a single habitat. 
Activity 12.2: Let us record
We can understand the population of a particular type of plant 

by counting them at a given place and time. 
 
Divide students into four to five groups. 
 
Each group may identify any two organisms, plant(s) or 

animal(s).
 
Mark an area of 1 m × 1 m in your school garden.
 
Identify four organisms in this area, and count their numbers. 
 
Record the number of the organisms in Table 12.2.
 
Compile the data from all groups.

194
From Activity 12.2, we can explain that the population is a group 
of the same type of organisms in a habitat at a given time. 
Can a habitat have only one type of living organism? What might 
happen then? If all organisms are the same, they would have the 

same requirements
 
Š
 
food,water, 
space
 
Š
 
leading to 
competition and 
possible scarcity of resources. What else do you think could happen?
In Activities 12.1 and 12.2, you observed that different 
group of organisms live together in a habitat. A 
community
 

comprises different populations sharing the same habitat. The 

biotic components of a habitat, such as the plants, animals, and 

microorganisms together form the community. These organisms 
interact and depend on one another for survival.

You may have seen brightly coloured flowers blooming around you. 

Have you ever looked closely at their parts? A flower has a stalk, green 

leafy structures called 
sepals
, coloured 
petals 
and two reproductive 
parts. 
Carpels
 (female) and stamens (male). 
Stamens burst release yellow dust like 
pollen 

grains
. Wind, ‚water insects, bats and birds  helps 

carry pollen from the stamens to the carpels of 

the same and different flowers. This process is 

called 
pollination
 (Fig.12.2). It is essential for 
the formation of fruits and seeds.

two ponds
 
Š
 
A withfish 
and large number 
of flowering plants around it; B without 
fish and fewer flowering plants around 

it (Fig. 12.3). Think of a reason for these 

observations.
 
Compare
 the number of dragonflies, 

bees, and butterflies in both the ponds. 

Do you find any relationship between the 

number of dragonflies and bees/butterflies? 

We
 
observed that in Pond A (with fish) 
the 
number of dragonflies were less as 
compared to Pond B. Why?
 
Fish eat dragonfly larvae, so ponds with fish 

had fewer dragonflies. Dragonflies usually 

eat flies, bees and butterflies With fewer 

dragonflies, more bees, flies, and butterflies 

were found. These insects help pollinate flowers from nearby 

areas moving pollen from one flower to another, which helps 

plants produce seeds. So, flowers near ponds with fish may 

produce more seeds than those near ponds without fish.
 
What does this study show? How does the population of fish 

in a pond affect the seed production in nearby plants?  
 
This study shows how biotic components (fish, dragonflies, 

pollinators, plants) and abiotic components (temperature, 

water, nutrients) interact with and affect each other 

(Fig. 12.4). Similarly, can overfishing by humans change this 

balance? How do you think it may affect the living and 

non-living parts of the habitat?

What 
Ar
e the Different Types of Interactions 
Among Organisms and their Surroundings?
In 
Curiosity
, Grade 7, you learn about how 
plants and animals need air, water, soil, and 

sunlight to grow. Living organisms, or the biotic 

community, depend on non-living things, that 

is abiotic components for their survival. Plants 

and animals also depend on each other for 

nutrition, respiration, and reproduction. These are 

interactions among the biotic components. Both 

types of interactions
 
Š
 
among biotic components, 
and between biotic and abiotic components
 
Š
 
are 
important for survival in any habitat.

In Activity 12.4, you understood different 
types of interactions  occur within a habitat. From 
this, you can infer that the biotic components 

(plants, animals, and microorganisms) and the 

abiotic components (air, water, soil, sunlight, 

and temperature) in a habitat interact with each 

other to form an 
ecosystem
. Organisms in an 

ecosystem interact with abiotic components 

for food, shelter, and protection in an 

ecosystem. Different communities of living 

organisms interact with abiotic components 

in an ecosystems. There are two main types 

of ecosystems in nature. 
Aquatic ecosystems 

include ponds, rivers, and lakes while 
terrestrial 

ecosystems
 include forests, farms or even large trees like banyan, 

mango, or 
pilkhan
. Hence, ecosystems can be large or small. Can 

you find overlapping ecosystems in Fig. 12.6? 
Fig. 12.6 shows an overlap of different terrestrial and 
aquatic ecosystems. In this figure, you can see a small river (an 
aquatic ecosystem) along withmountains, forests, grassland, 

and farmland, which are examples of terrestrial ecosystems. 

Farmland is a 
human-made ecosystem
. These ecosystems are 

interacting with each other at any given point.
In Activity 12.4, we have seen the importance of the components 
and their interactions in an ecosystem. For example, sunlight, 

carbon dioxide, and water are essential for producing food in plants; 

soil provides medium and essential nutrients for plant growth; air 

provides oxygen for respiration in plants as well as animals; water is 

essential for all living organisms. This shows how living organisms 

depend on the non-living component of an ecosystem.
Just as biotic components depend on abiotic components, abiotic 
components also depend on biotic components. For example, 

plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, roots hold soil in 

place and prevent erosion, and plants retain soil moisture and 

help cool the atmosphere.
You can identify and study any ecosystem in your surroundings 
andobserve different types of interactions among the bioticand 

abiotic components. While studyingbiotic interactions, notice 

how organisms depend on each other for food.
Observe Fig 12.1b, which illustrates a forest ecosystem.

Using the internet or your school library, find out whatdo 
these organisms eat.
 
Record your observations in Table 12.4 by identifying whether 

each organism feeds only on plants and plant products, only 

on animals, or on both.

How do plants get their food? As you know, plants make their 

own food by the process of photosynthesis. Thus, they are called 

producers
 or 
autotrophs
 (
auto
=self + 
troph
=food).
Organisms that cannot produce their own food and depend 
on other organisms for their food are called 
consumers
 or 
heterotrophs
 (
hetero
 = other + 
troph
 = food). List the heterotrophs 

from Table 12.4.
Organisms that eat only plants are called 
herbivores
, such 
as deer and hare. Those that eat only animals are 
carnivores
, 

such as leopard. Organisms that eat both plants and animals are 

omnivores
, such as crows, foxes, and mice.
12.5 Who Eats Whom?
In Activity 12.5, we learn about the feeding relationship 
among organisms. How can we make linkages with the feeding 

relationship among organisms in a given ecosystem?

Activity 12.6: Let us link (relate)
 
Take an example of a grassland ecosystem. 
 
Consider the following organisms that we can spot in a 
grassland ecosystem: grass, frog, hare, fox, grasshopper, 

snake, and eagle.
 
In Fig. 12.8, a relationship of who eats whom is shown among 

some of the organisms.
 
Draw
 the feeding relationships for the remaining organisms by 

adding arrows, similar to those in Fig. 12.8.
In Fig 12.8, you can see that the grass is eaten by the hare and the 

hare is eaten by the fox. This is a representation of a food chain 

in a grassland ecosyste m. Which is another food chain that can 

be drawn for the organisms given in this activity? One example 

may be as follows: 
Grass 
 Grasshopper 
 Frog 
 Snake 
 Eagle
Theinteractions between biotic components based on feeding 
relationships can be represented in the form of a linear chain. 

A 
food chain
 is a simple sequence showing ‚who eats whom™ in 
an ecosystem. One such example is given in Fig. 12.9. 
Activity 12.7: Let us draw
Fig. 12.10a represents a crop field with millets, mouse, and eagle.
 
Count 
the number of each type of organism in Fig. 12.10a.
 
Make a table and set a number in the table against each of 

the organisms. 
 
Arrange the numbers in the ascending 

order, consider the highest number at  

the base and the lowest at the top.
 
Place the mouse, millet, and eagle 

appropriately in Fig. 12.10b.
 
What figure do you get? It looks like 

a pyramid. Complete the pyramid in 

Fig. 12.10b.  
Each organism in a food chain has a 
specific position, called a 
trophic level
 

(
troph
 = food):
 
Producers (like green plants) are at 

the first trophic level.

How many other organisms 

might be connected to one 

organism through a feeding 

relationship in an ecosystem?
Look at Fig. 12.11, and 
observe the relationship 

between different food chains 

in an ecosystem. Are these food 

chains interlinked? Each of the 

organisms may be eaten by two 

or more types of organisms. 

Thus, in an ecosystem, the food 

chains are interlinked with each 

other to form a network, called a 

food web
. 
You know that living organisms 
grow, perform many functions,  

develop, and die. During their life 

cycle, organisms produce a lot of 

waste, including dead matter and 

food waste.
12.6 What Happens to Waste in Nature? 
You may have seen small umbrella-like structures,  

mushrooms, growing on dead plants or trees during the 

rainy season (Fig.
 
12.12). These are a type of fungi that
 
grow on dead matter. Microorganisms like fungi and 

bacteria break down complex substances in dead plants

decomposition 
and the 
organisms carrying out the process are called 
decomposers

saprotrophs
 (
sapro

process. Thus, decomposers play an important role in recycling 

nutrients. In nature, nothing is wasted

India is a country with diverse habitats and seasons. Many 
migratory  
birds
 fly thousands of miles and reach different habitats in India. They  

migrate from different parts of the world to avoid harsh climate, and in  

search for food. Birds not only enhance the aesthetics of those habitats 

but also play a significant role in keeping the balance in an ecosystem 

as 
pollinators
 or seed dispersers along the path they migrate. This 
way they link two habitats. These birds are 
predators
 of insect pests 

and help farmers to control pest populations, and indirectly help 

in healthy crop growth. Migratory birds, Demoiselle Crane visit the 

water body of Khichan village in Jodhpur district during the winter 

months. Do you know which birds in your area are seen only during  

winter? 
Collect 
postal stamps and covers of migratory birds released 
by the Indian Postal Department, and collect information about their 

place of origin and reasons for their migration to different localities 

in India and more. 
Showcase
 the postal stamps in your science 
laboratory/school library to popularise migratory birds.
12.7 How Does One Change Lead to Another? 
Look at Fig. 12.13. It shows how one small change can lead to 
many others. For example, many plants in a pond start dying 

because of pollution. With fewer plants less oxygen will be

produced in water which will lead to a drop in the 
fish population in that water body. Reduction in fish 

population will have cascading effects and there will 

be less number of consumers in the pond. As a result,  

insects will increase in number. These insects will 

spread to nearby farmlands. This is how farmers will 

be compelled to use pesticides to grow their crops 

which may again adversely affect the environment.  

Further consequences may emerge in the form of 

other 
environmental issues

What happens when we intervene in nature?
Activity 12.9: Let us read
In the 1980s, India was a significant exporter of frog 

legs, especially of the Indian bullfrog (
Hoplobatrachus
 

tigerinus
) (Fig. 12.14). This large-scale harvesting led 

to a decline in frog populations. Since frogs eat insects, 

their reduced numbers resulted in a rise in agricultural 

pests. This forced farmers to use more synthetic 

pesticides, which harmed the environment, soil and 

water quality, and affected the overall environmental 

and human health. The Government of India banned 

the export of frog legs to prevent further 
ecological 

damage
. 
An ecosystem stays in balance when interactions 
among organisms and their environment keep 

populations and resources stable. This balance is 

dynamic, not fixed, and can be disrupted by natural 

or human-made changes.

community in an ecosystem
12.8 
 
How Do Interactions Maintain 

Balance in Ecosyst
ems?
Besides feeding relationships, organisms also 

compete for common resources like food, water, 

physical space, or sunlight.  
This competition helps control population 
size and keeps the ecosystem balanced. Without 

it, one species could multiply too much causing 

an imbalance in the ecosystem (Fig. 12.15).
There are other types of relationships too. 
Based on the example given in Fig. 12.16, what 

do you observe?

Mutualism:
 Both organisms

Honeybees and flowers.
 
Commensalism:
 One organism 

benefits while the other is not

Parasitism:
 One organism 

benefits while the other is 

harmed. For example: Ticks on 

the body of dogs.
These interactions are all part 

of the complex web of life in an 

ecosystem.

Be a scientist
Asir Jawahar Thomas Johnsingh (A.J.T. Johnsingh) 

was a famous Indian wildlife biologist who helped 

us understand forest ecosystems through the eyes of 

animals. He was a pioneer in studying wildlife through 

modern tracking system. His research showed how 

predators like tigers and leopards rely on prey, such as 

deer and wild boar, while he was working in Bandipur 

National Park, Karnataka. He proved that a healthy prey 
population is key to predator survival. He inspired many youngsters 

to study wildlife and protect the forests and biodiversity of India.
12.9 What Are the Benefits of an Ecosystem?
We have learnt that biotic components and abiotic components 

of an ecosystem depend on each other and support various life 

processes. Humans also benefit from ecosystems. For example, 

forests provide fresh air, fertile soil, food, fibres, timber, and 

medicines. Similarly, aquaticecosystems provide water and 

food. Ecosystems also offer aesthetic and recreational value. 

This benefits and supports our well-being and shows how closely 

nature and humans are connected. However, when we overuse 

or misuse natural resources, we disturb the balance in nature.
Now let us look at a real-life example of a threatened ecosystem 
Š the Sundarbans.

The S
u
ndarbans have the 
largest mangrove forests in the 
world. Located where the Ganges 

and Brahmaputra Rivers meet 

between India and Bangladesh, the 

Sundarbans™ forests and rivers are 

home to various flora and fauna, 

many of which are endangered.
 The 
Sundarbans protect us by slowing 

down strong winds and waves 



also absorb carbon dioxide from 

the air and release oxygen. Because 

of its importance, The United 

Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared the Sundarbans a World 



under a serious threat. Mangrove trees are being cut for fuelwood 

and farming. Illegal hunting and overuse of forest resources are 

a threat to the wildlife living there. Pollution from industrial 

waste and untreated sewage in rivers are also damaging the 

water and habitat. These human activities disrupt the natural way 

ecosystems work.
Similarly, other ecosystems across India are also under threat. 
Problems like deforestation, overuse of natural resources, the 

spread of invasive species, unsustainable land use, and pollution 

are damaging forests, rivers, scrublands, wetlands, grasslands, 

and coastal areas.
How can we stop damaging forests, rivers, and wetlands? 
Think about what actions you and your community can take to 

protect these important places.
Protected areas are parts of land or water set aside to conserve wildlife 
and their habitats. India has many protected areas like national parks, 

wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, and community conserved 

areas. These places help protect entire habitats including endangered 

animals, birds, and many rare plants. Famous examples include Jim 

Corbett National Park (Uttarakhand), Manas National Park (Assam), 

Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (Western Ghats), Chilika Lake (Odisha), 

Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh), Hemis National 

Park (Leh), Keibul Lamjao National Park (Manipur), Pirotan Island 

Marine National Park (Gujarat). Protected areas play a big role in 

saving nature for future generations.

12.9.1 Human-made ecosystems
Humans have created artificial ecosystems like fish ponds, 
farms, and parks to meet their needs. When well designed, these 

can help reduce pollution, support biodiversity, and provide 

recreational spaces for people. Unlike natural ecosystems, these 

need human care and management. Can you name any human 

made ecosystem in your area?
12.9.2 How do healthy ecosystems serve our farms?
Farming, a major livelihood in India, can become unsustainable 

if not managed well by applying environment friendly farming 

practices.
Humans have been practising farming for thousands of 
years to grow food. As the population grew, our dependence on 

agriculture increased. Between 1950 and 1965, India faced a food 

crisis due to low crop production. In the mid-20th century, the 

use of tractors, machines, synthetic fertilisers, and pesticides 

helped increase food production. This period is known as the 

Green Revolution
. However, these farming methods are now 

considered unsustainable because of the overuse of synthetic 

chemicals, excessive groundwater extraction, and growing only 

one type of crop for commercial gain. How do these practices 

harm both the environment and human health?
Many scientists believe that overusing pesticides and growing 
the same type of crop repeatedly on the same land leads to soil 

degradation. Understanding ecosystems can help us adopt better 

and more sustainable farming practices.
Activity 12.10: Let us survey
Visit a nearby farm with your parents or teacher/interact with 

farmers in your community to find out about the farming 

practices they adopt.
 
Prepare
 a list of questions for farmers to find out the 

pesticides and other farm inputs they use, and whether they 

reuse or recycle materials to improve their crops. Here are 

some sample questions:
 
How have your farming practices changed over time?  

And why?
 
What effects do you notice when using synthetic fertilisers 

and pesticides?
 
Have you seen any changes in soil health after using these 

synthetic fertilisers and pesticides?
 
Interact 
with farmers based on these questions. Based on 
your findings, prepare a report.

206
What inference do you draw from your 
interactions with farmers?
Synthetic fertilisers and pesticides have played 
a vital role in improving crop production and 
helpedcountries like India become food secure. 

However, their long-term use can affect the 

environment andsoil health. Overuse of synthetic 

fertilisers may reduce soil fertility by decreasing 

friendly microorganisms in soil and lowering 

organic matter (humus), which helps bind soil 

particles. Withoutenough humus, soil becomes 

prone to erosion. Also, it reduces the population of 

natural predators which ultimately increase the 
population of pests (Fig. 12.18). Heavy irrigation and repeated 

ploughing can also disturb soil organisms like earthworms and 

snails, which are important for maintaining ecological balance.
Some pests may develop resistance to pesticides, making them 
difficult to control. Growing the same crop repeatedly, known as 

monoculture
, can reduce crop diversity and affect pollinators, 

which are crucial for food production. 
To make farming more sustainable, some farmers are 
exploring organic and natural farming methods. These aim to 

reduce the use of synthetic fertilisers and support sustainable 

farming, with minimal interference in natural ecosystems. 

Based on your learning, what practices do you think can help 

farmers protect the soil, the environment, and our food security 

for the future?
The ancient text 
Vrikshayurveda
 emphasises on soil health and 

nourishment. The text strongly advocates for the continuous 

nourishment of the soil through organic manure like 
Kunapa Jala
 (a 
liquid fertiliser made from animal and plant waste by the process of 

fermentation; that breaks complex substances into simpler ones) and 

other composted materials.

Habitats have biotic components (plants, animals, microbes) and 
abiotic components (air, water, soil, temperature).
 
The interaction between biotic components and abiotic components 

in an area forms an ecosystem.
 
Ecosystems can be terrestrial (forests, grasslands, deserts) or aquatic 

(ponds, lakes, sea, oceans).
 
Organisms often classified as producers (plants), consumers 

(herbivores, carnivores, omnivores), and decomposers (bacteria, 

fungi).
 
Producers make their own food, while consumers eat plants 

or animals. Decomposers break down dead matter and recycle 

nutrients.
 
Food chains depict who eats whom in an ecosystem, and food webs 

show how these chains are interconnected. The positions that 

different organisms occupy in a food chain are called trophic levels.
 
Some organisms live in relationships, like mutualism (both benefit), 

commensalism (one benefits, other is unaffected), and parasitism 

(one benefits, one is harmed).
 
The benefits that ecosystems offer are crucial for humansurvival 

and well-being. They provide clean air, water, food, medicine, and 

climate regulation.
 
Human activities like pollution, deforestation, habitat loss, climate 

change, invasive species, and overexploitation of natural resources 

threaten ecosystems. Protecting them through efforts, such as 

conservation like national parks and sanctuaries is vital.

We have now reached the final chapter of this book, the 
concluding chapter in our scientific journey through the middle 
stage. It is time to put together all that we have seen and learnt 

and try to understand why our home, planet Earth, is like 

no other place in the known universe. As you have learnt in 

Curiosity
, Grades 6 and 7, the Earth is a planet orbiting the Sun. 

However, it is not just any planet. It is a planet that sustains 

life
 
Š
 
full of diverse landscapes, from towering mountains 
and vast oceans to endless deserts and lush forests. Today, our
 
satellites allow us to take amazing pictures of our planet. The 

image in the beginning  page was taken by an Indian Space 

Research Organisation (ISRO) Earth Observation Satellite and 

made by combining nearly 3000 smaller images, like pieces of 

a mosaic. Although it looks beautiful, it™s a false colour image, 

where scientists use different colours to show different types of 

information. These satellite images help us study plants on land 

and tiny organisms in the ocean, and can even detect things 

like ocean temperature, oil spills, and wind direction. Inthis 

chapter, we will uncover the unique conditions that make Earth 

the perfect home for living beings.
13.1 Why Is Earth a Unique Planet?
What makes the Earth so special? While there are perhaps 

billions of planets in the universe, Earth is the only one where 

life, as we know today, exists and thrives in all its forms.
Have you ever wondered 
where all life on Earth 

actually exists? All the 

mountains, rivers, forests, 

animals, and people are 

found on just a very thin 

layer on the surface of our 

planet. From the tallest 

mountain to the deepest 

ocean trench, the crust, 

where all of life exists, is 

tiny compared to the size of 

Earth. If Earth were the size 

of an apple, the crust would 

be as thin as the apple™s 

skin as shown in Fig. 13.1. 

This delicate, life supporting layer is what makes Earth truly 

special.

friends. You may realise that the Earth is interesting and important  

to us in many ways. It provides us with the air that we breathe, the 

water that we drink, and the soil that helps in growing crops. The 

Earth also provides us materials like rock and timber with which 

we build our homes, buildings, and roads. You must be curious 

to know what makes the Earth a unique planet which not only  

allows life like us to exist but also sustains it.

What Do the Planets of Our Solar S

Look Like?
In 
Curiosity, 
Grade 6, you had studied the solar system in the 
chapter ‚Beyond Earth™. Let us recall some of the things we had 

learnt. Our solar system has eight planets that go around the Sun 

in nearly circular orbits. In order of their increasing distance 

from the Sun, they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, 
I wonder what makes the Earth 

unique for living beings to grow 

and survive!

Table 13.2: Planets in our solar system
We know that all planets in the solar system get their energy 
from the Sun. Thus, when a planet is close to the Sun, it would 

be very hot. As we move away from the Sun, planets should get 

colder. Is this what you found in Table 13.2? This is generally 

correct, except that Venus, the second planet from the Sun has 

the highest average temperature and is the hottest planet. Why
 
is 
this so? 
Venus is the hottest planet not because it is the closest 
to the Sun, but because its thick atmosphere traps heat.

214
The air
 
on Venus is almost entirely made up of carbon 
dioxide gas, which does not let the heat escape. This 
is called the 
greenhouse effect 
(Fig. 13.2), and it 
makes Venus even hotter than Mercury, which is 
relatively closer to the Sun. On the Earth also, gases 

like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat 

by absorbing the radiation given off by the Earth, 

after it gets warmed by the Sun. Thus, greenhouse 

effect plays an important role in maintaining just 

the right temperature on Earth.
A step further
The greenhouse effect that causes 

a planet like Venus and Earth to 

trap heat does not work the same 

way as a greenhouse for growing 

plants in a cool climate. On Venus 

or Earth, gases like carbon dioxide 

in the atmosphere trap heat by 

absorbing the radiation given off 

by the Earth, after it gets warmed 

by the Sun. A plant greenhouse, on 

the other hand, traps warmed air 

simply because it is a closed space, usually with glass walls (Fig. 13.3). 

It heats up during the day, but the air stays in and the heat does not 

escape easily. So while both keep things warm, they do it differently!

13. 3 What Makes the Earth Suitable for Life to 
 
          Exist ?
13.3.1 Position of the Earth
The most important reason why the Earth 

can support life is its distance from the 

Sun. It is just at the right distance, where 

the temperature allows water to exist in a 

liquid form. If the Earth were closer to the 

Sun, it would be too hot and all the water 

would evaporate; if it were farther away, 

it would be too cold, and all the water 

would freeze.  In such extreme conditions, 

it would have been impossible for most 

life forms

especially plants, animals, and

bacteria, can survive in frozen environments, from 
what we know so far, liquid water is essential for 

life to evolve. Earth™s distance from the Sun allows 

water to remain mostly in liquid form, which is 

essential for the development and sustenance of life 

in all its form. The range of distances from the Sun 

(or another star) over which water remains liquid is 

called the 
habitable zone
, or sometimes also called 

the ‚
Goldilocks zone
™ (Fig.
 
13.4).
As you have also studied in Social Science, most of 
Earth™s surface is covered with water. Thus, when seen 

from space, the Earth looks blue because of the vast 

amount of waterŠhence the name Blue Planet (Fig. 13.5).
Did Mars ever support life?
Mars lies at the edge of the Sun™s habitable zone. Several spacecrafts 
have been sent to Mars, rovers have landed and explored its surface, 

but no proof of life has been found yet. However, scientists think 

that in the past, Mars may have had 

liquid water
 
Š
 
maybe even 
some 
lakes
 
Š
 
and conditions that could 
support simple life forms (Fig.
 
13.6). 
This is one reason Mars continues 
to interest scientists. It also reminds 

us 
that science doesn™t always have 
final answers. As we explore more, 

we may find new cluesŠor even 

new kinds of life. Science stays open 

to change when we learn more.

Is the temperature or distance from the Sun, the 

only factor that makes the Earth habitable?
What would happen if the size of the Earth 

were too small or too big?
13.3.2 Size of the Earth
There are some other important factors that make the Earth 

habitable. In our solar system, the orbits of most planets, 

including the Earth are almost circular. This keeps the amount of

sunlight and heat nearly steady throughout the year, preventing 
extreme summers and winters at most places. 
However, moderate temperature due to the right distance 
from the Sun isn™t the only factor that makes the Earth habitable. 

The planet is also the right size to support an atmosphere. As you 

learnt earlier, the atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds 

the Earth, and it plays a major role in sustaining life. You also 

learnt in Chapter 5 that the Earth™s gravity pulls objects towards it. 

If Earth were much smaller (but with the same average density), 

its gravity would have been too weak to hold on to the gases in 

our atmosphere, and they would have escaped into space. On 

Mars, the atmosphere is 100 times thinner than on Earth, and 

Mercury has no atmosphere at all.
On the other hand, if the planet was too large, and gravity was 
much stronger, it would perhaps pull us down to the planet with 

such a large force that our bones could get crushed! Due to the 

right size of the Earth, it is able to support atmosphere which is 

essential for life.
The presence of oxygen in the Earth™s atmosphere allows us 
to breathe, and is needed by almost all forms of life on Earth. 

But oxygen has another important role. Some of the oxygen in 

our atmosphere, gets converted to another form called ozone 

(a
 
three-atom oxygen molecule), and forms an important part 
of the atmosphere called the 
ozone layer
. This layer acts like a 
shield, blocking harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun that 

can damage living cells.
India™s Mangalyaan (Mars  

Orbiter Mission), launched  

in 2013 by Indian Space  

Research Organisation (ISRO), 

was a big step in exploring  

Mars (Fig.
 
13.7). It carried
 
tools to study the planet™s  

atmosphere, surface, and signs 

of past water. Some of these 

sensors help scientists ask  

big questions
 
Š
 
likewas Mars
 
ever suitable for life? Mangalyaan showed the world that India could  

do space science with smart, low-cost technology
 
Š
 
andit helped bring
 
Mars closer to all of us.

In 
Curiosity,
 Grade 6, we learnt that 
a freely suspended magnet always 
settles in a fixed direction. This is 

because the Earth itself behaves 

like a giant magnet. You have also 

seen in Chapter 4 that the region around a magnet where its 

effect is felt has a magnetic field. It is believed that the movement 

of molten iron in Earth™s core may be the origin for Earth™s 

magnetic field. 
Earth is constantly hit by tiny, high-energy particles that 
come from space. Some come from far across the universe and 

are called 
cosmic rays
. Other particles come from the Sun and 

are called the 
solar wind
. These particles can be harmful as they 

can damage the atmosphere, reduce the ozone layer, and let in 

more harmful UV rays, which can affect life on Earth.
Thankfully, the Earth™s magnetic field acts like a protective 
shield. It pushes many of these harmful particles away from the 

Earth, keeping our atmosphere, and hence life on our planet safe.
Earth™s unique position in the solar system
 
Š
 
allows the 
presence of liquid 
water
 
Š
 
along with 
its size, atmosphere, and 
magnetic field, all help make it a planet where life can emerge 

and thrive.
But, how is life supported and 

sustained on Earth?
Does the magnetic field of 

the Earth have any role in 

sustaining life on Earth?
13.4 What Allows Life to Be Sustained on Earth?
Earth has the right conditions for life, but it is the beautiful 

connections between living and non-living things that help life to 

thrive. In 
Curiosity
, 
Grades 6 and 7, you learnt about key natural 
resources, such as, air, water, sunlight, soil, and minerals. 

You
 
also learnt about the important life processes in plants and 
animals. Now, 
let us 
explore
 how all these elements interact to 
support and sustain life on Earth.
13.4.1 Air, water, and sunlight
We know that the atmosphere contains oxygen, which humans, 

animals, and plants use for respiration. In the presence of 

sunlight, plants take carbon dioxide from the air and water from 
Chapter 13.indd   217
Chapter 13.indd   217

6/28/2025   6:15:59 PM

218
t h e  soil to prepare food by photosynthesis. In the process, oxygen is  
released, which is needed for respiration.
We have learnt, radiation from the Sun heats the Earth. Some
 
of 
this heat is trapped by the atmosphere due to the greenhouse 

effect. 
This effect though mild, keeps the temperature just high 
enough for water to remain in the liquid state. In 
Curiosity
, 

Grade
 
7, you also learnt about heat transfer 
by radiation. Without 
an atmosphere, the Earth would lose heat to space and become 

too cold. So the greenhouse effect helps keep the Earth warm.
Water is essential for life. You have learnt that it covers about  
70 per cent of the Earth™s surface and is found in ponds, lakes,  
rivers, springs, seas, oceans, and groundwater.  

All this water forms the 
hydrosphere
. 

In
 
Chapter 7, you learnt that water is a good
 
solvent. In 
Curiosity, 
Grade 7, we learnt  
how water transports nutrients from soil to  

leaves in plants. In animals, it regulates body  

temperature, aids digestion, and ensures  

hydration, all essential for health and life.
Though much of Earth is covered by 
water, we still know little about what lives 

deep in the oceans. The hydrosphere is home 
to millions of life forms, from tiny planktons to giant whales, 

many still being discovered. Oceans, lakes, and rivers provide 

rich environments for aquatic life (Fig. 13.8). Freshwater is also 

needed to grow crops and support people around the world.
Water vapour in the air forms clouds and brings rain or snow. 
This refills rivers, lakes, and underground water. Rainfall affects 

the kinds of plants and animals that can live in a place. Moving 

air also shapes weather and rainfall
 
Š
 
which influence farming, 
water supply, and life on land.
13.4.2 Soil, rocks, and minerals
Beneath our feet lies something remarkable
 
Š
 
the Earth™s crust, 
made of rocks, soil, and minerals. It may seem hard and lifeless,
 
but it provides almost everything life needs to grow and survive.  

From soil that helps plants grow to minerals that give us salt, coal,  

oil, and metals like iron and copper
 
Š
 
this outer layer support 
both ecosystems and human life. The solid parts of the Earth,
 
including materials like rocks, soils, and minerals are known as 

the 
geosphere
.
Soil may look like simple dirt, but it is rich in nutrients like 
nitrogen and potassium that plants need to grow. These nutrients 

come from the slow breakdown of rocks and the remains of 

plants and animals.

There are various types of landforms, 
rocks, soils, etc., on Earth. This variety along 
with the processes that shape and alter them 

is called 
geodiversity 
(Fig.
 
13.9). I
t helps 
create unique habitats where different 

types of life can thrive. The non-living parts 

of nature, like soil, rocks, and water, aren™t 

just a background
 
Š
 
they help shape the 
story of life itself.
13.4.3 Plants, animals, and microorganisms
From the chapter on microbes to the chapter on ecology, we have 

seen that the Earth is full of life
 
Š
 
from trees, shrubs, herbs, to 
animals, insects, and tiny organisms invisible to the naked eye. 

All living beings, along with the places where they live, make 

up the 
biosphere
. This includes land, water, and air, where life 
interacts with its surroundings to survive and grow.
As you learnt in Chapter 12, living beings depend on one 
another and their environment. Plants make food through 

photosynthesis, animals eat plants or other animals, and 

decomposers break down dead matter and return nutrients to 

the soil. Nature works together as a system to support life.
13.4.4 The importance of balance
Have you ever wondered how so many things on Earth stay in 

balance? Earth is like a giant teamwork project between nature, 

weather, and life itself. It is a vast, living system where land, air, 

water, and living things support and affect one another. Even 

a small change in one part
 
Š
 
like cutting down a forest
 
Š
 
can 
impact rainfall, soil, air quality, and the animals that live there. 

Life on Earth survives not because of just one thing, but because 

everythingworks 
together in balance. It is this balance that 
keeps our planet habitable. That™s why preserving and protecting 

clean air, water, soil, and all forms of life isn™t just important but 

essential for keeping Earth healthy for the future.
13.5 What Keeps Life from Disappearing?
If plants and animals didn™t reproduce, life would eventually 

disappear from Earth. Reproduction ensures that each type of 

organism continues to exist, maintaining the continuity of life.
We usually expect that animals will produce young ones that 
resemble them
 
Š
 
cows have calves, and cats have kittens. This 
happens because parents pass on instructions to their offspring 

about how to develop from a single cell. These instructions, 
 Fig. 13.9: Geodiversity
Chapter 13.indd   219
Chapter 13.indd   219

220
called 
genetic material
 or 
genes
, are stored inside every cell of 
a living being. You can think of genes as a detailed instruction 
manual inside each cell. Some instructions tell the cell how to 

make blood, while others guide the formation of bones, muscles, 

or skin. Together, these instructions ensure that a calf grows into 

a cow, or a kitten grows into a cat.
But reproduction does more than just create more of the same kind  
of living beings. It also allows for small changes in the instructions  

that are passed down from parents to offpsrings. Sometimes, these  

changes help a plant or animal survive better in a new environment.  

For example, over time, camels developed humps to store fat and  

survive in deserts. Even microbes evolve
 
Š
 
some bacteria, as you 
learnt in the chapter on health, have become resistant to antibiotics,
 
helping them persist. Over many generations, such changes can lead  

to new features
 
Š
 
or even completely new types of living beings. So, 
reproduction not only keeps each kind continuing, but also helps
 
life adapt change, and continue in new forms (Fig.
 
13.10).
But how can the same process lead both to similarity (an animal
 
gives birth to similar individual, such as a cow gives birth to a cow)  

and variation (shows different characteristics like difference in  
color and height of to individuals of  

some kind)? That is a fascinating puzzle. 

There are two types of reproductive  

processes
 
Š
 
one in which the young 
are almost exactly like their parent
 
and another in which they look slightly  

different from their parents.
In asexual reproduction, a single 
parent produces new individuals that 
are exact copies of itself (exact in terms of the instructions inside 

the cell). In sexual reproduction, instructions from two parents 

combine to create offspring that are not exactly like either of 

the parent. They share some traits with both parents, but also 

have differences. This mixing helps keep useful features while 

allowing new ones to appear. Over many generations, these 

small differences can add up
 
Š
 
leading to big differences, and 
even new life forms.
Let™s explore how reproduction takes place in plants and 
animals, and how it helps living beings develop special features 

and sometimes change over time. 
13.5.1 Asexual reproduction
Many plants can reproduces when any part of the plants
 
Š
 
leaf, 
stem, or root
 
Š
 
is planted in soil. This kind of reproduction is 
called 
vegetative propagation.

Can you 
observe
 and list some 
plants around you that grow this 

way?
 
Take some parts of plants like stem cutting of a money plant,  

the ‚eyes™ of a sprouted potato, or a piece of ginger (Fig. 13.11b).
 
Plant each of them separately in moist soil (not too deep). For 

money plant, you can just put a cutting in a glass container 

which makes it easy to observe.
 
Make sure they get all the conditions they need to growŠlike 

water, air, and sunlight.
 
Watch them every day and note how many days it takes for 

roots stem and leaves to appear. Also observe when the first 

new leaf appears.
Ever heard of ...
Not just plants Œ microbes and simple animals also reproduce  

asexually. For example, single-celled organisms like bacteria and  

amoebae divide into two identical individuals. Some multicell
ular  

organisms like algae can regrow from small cut parts.  

Hydra, another simple animal, grows tiny buds on its  

body that break off and grow into new individuals.
Planaria, a type of flatworm, can regrow from just 
a small piece of their body! Scientists study them to 

understand regeneration in animals.

Fig. 13.12: Planaria
13.5.2 Sexual reproduction 
In this type of reproduction, two parents are involved
 
Š
 
usually 
called male and female. This is easy to observe in animals, but 

did you know even flowering plants have male and female parts? 

Some microorganisms like bacteria and yeast also have two 

‚mating types™ that act like the two parents.
Special cells for reproduction
You might wonder if both parents pass on their genetic material 

for making a new organism, won™t the child end up with double 

the amount of instructions? And would not this keep doubling 

every generation?
This does not happen because each parent makes specialised 
reproductive cells, called 
gametes
. These carry only half of the 

parent™s genetic material . When male and female gametes join, 

they form a new cell with a complete set of instructions
 
Š
 
half 
from each parent.
How do bamboo and sugarcane 

grow into new plants? I have 

never seen their seeds.

222
Babies do not look exactly like their mother or father. Even 
brothers and sisters in the same family can look different from 
each other. This is because every baby gets a mix of genetic 

information from both parents through gametes. Each gamete 

carries a different set of instructions for things like eye colour, hair 

type, and more. These instructions mix in different ways when 

the sperm and eggs joins to form a baby. These instructions mix 

in different ways each time, so each child is unique. No wonder 

one child may ‚inherit™ a nose similar to mother and another may 

inherit eyes similar to father. It all depends on which pieces of 

the parent™s ‚instruction book set™ came together.
Sexual reproduction in plants
Plants use different parts of their flowers to produce 

male and female gametes. Pollen grains found inside the 

anther of a flower are the male gametes, while ovules, 

found deep inside the flower, are the female gametes. 

Pollen is carried to another flower by wind, insects, or 

animals
 
Š
 
this process is called 
pollination
. When the 
male and female gametes combine, it is called 
fertilisation
, 

forming a zygote that becomes the seed. The fleshy part of the 

flower around the ovule develops into a fruit (Fig.
 
13.13).
When birds or animals eat the fruit, the seeds often get 
dropped far from the original plant
 
Š
 
a helpful way for plants 
to spread. That™s how a banyan seed, dropped by a bird that ate 

a fruit and excreted the seed, might sprout in a crack in a wall 

after the rains. When seeds get water, they use stored nutrients 

to grow roots and shoots. Remember in Grade 6 you had studied 

thegermination of 
seeds where you observed tiny shoots and the 
first leaves appear.
Sexual reproduction in animals
In animals, gametes are called sperm (male) and eggs 

(female). Fertilisation may take place in water, for example, 

male and female fish or frogs eject sperm and eggs, 

respectively, into the water where they combine to form 

the zygote. In these animals, the development of the zygote 

into an embryo also takes place in water (Fig. 13.14).
In birds and mammals, including humans, sperm 
are deposited inside the female and fertilisation takes 

place when the sperm swim towards the egg produced 

by the female. After this step, birds and mammals follow 

different processes.

223
In birds, the fertilised egg (zygote) is ‚laid™ by the female. 
The
 
development of the zygote into an embryo happens after the 
egg 
is laid during the hatching process. Think about how much 
‚food™ the female parent has to put into each egg
 
Š
 
it has to last 
for the developing embryo until it hatches. This is one strategy to 
ensures supply of nutrition to the embryo.
In most mammals, the development of the zygote into an 
embryo takes place inside the body of the female. The mother™s 

body provides 
all the food and oxygen the baby needs to grow 
until it is born. This is a different way of giving nutrition to the 

developing baby, compared to animals like birds that lay eggs. 

What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving birth to 

young ones vs. laying eggs? Do you think animals like dogs, cows, 

or humans could lay eggs like birds? Why or why not?
13.6 What Are the Threats to Life on Earth?
We know that life on Earth depends on a delicate balance of 

living and non-living things working together. But human 

actions are disturbing this balance. Even small changes in 

global temperature, oxygen levels, or the ozone layer can put 

life at risk.
Today, the biggest environmental challenges that we face 
are climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution
 
Š
 
together 
known as the triple planetary crisis.
Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil releases greenhouse gases 
like carbon dioxide and methane. These trap even more heat in 

theatmosphere 
which causes global warming. Normally, Earth 
keeps a balance since trees, plants, and even tiny ocean planktons 

absorb carbon dioxide as they grow. But when we burn fossil 

fuels, we release extra carbon that has been locked underground 

for millions of years. The Earth cannot absorb this fast enough, so 

the heat builds up. Even a small increase in temperature can melt 

ice caps, raise sea levels which could flood many coastal cities, 

cause extreme weather conditions, and lead to many plants and 

animals disappearing. These long-term changes in temperature, 

rainfall, and weather patterns are called 
climate change
. 
When natural habitats are destroyed, plants and animals 
may disappear, upsetting ecosystems. For example, as we saw in 

Chapter 12, if grasses vanish, animals that feed on them like deer 

or grasshoppers struggle to survive. And without herbivores, 

predators like tigers or foxes lose their food too. Every type of 

living thing has a role, and losing even a few weakens nature™s 

ability to support life.

224
Pollution adds to the problem. Air pollution 
from factories, vehicles, and burning fuels 
harms both people and the nature. It can 

cause breathing problems, damage crops, 

and lead to smog and acid rain (Fig. 13.15).
Climate change affects everythingŠfrom 
crop growth and water supply to wildlife 

habitats and human health. To protect life on 

Earth, we need to cut pollution, use cleaner 

energy, and make wiser choices. We have 

also learnt that life on Earth flourishes within 
a delicate balance supported by interdependent natural systems. 

However, this balance is increasingly threatened by human 

actions. For example, a little less or more of oxygen in air, or a 

little lower or higher temperature of the Earth, or a little less of 

ozone in the atmosphere, could endanger life on the Earth.
Countries around the world have made global agreements to protect 

the environment. The Montreal Protocol (1987) helped reduce 

harmful chemicals like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), allowing the 

ozone layer to slowly recover. The Earth Summit (1992) led to 

international efforts on climate change and biodiversity. Later, 

the Kyoto Protocol (2005) and Paris Agreement (2015) committed 

countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement 

set a goal to limit global warming to below 1.5 °C, but as of 2025, the 

world is not on track to meet that goal. Much more action is needed 

to avoid any more adverse effects of climate change.
Ever heard of ...
Water and soil pollution are serious threats to life 
(Fig.
 
13.16). Factory, farm and plastic waste harm aquatic
 
life and make water unsafe. Excess fertilisers and poor waste 

disposal pollute soil, reduce crop yield, and spread harmful 

substances through the food chain. Protecting them requires 
better waste management and sustainable 

farming practices.
We have seen above that all the Earth system, 
such as hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere and 

geosphere are connected
 
Š
 
so damage to one can 
affect the others. Protecting the climate means 

cutting down on greenhouse gases by using 

renewable energy like solar and wind, improving 

energy use, and choosing environmentally friendly 

ways to travel. At the same time, preserving

225
biodiversity is key as diverse ecosystems are stronger and more 
balanced. Local communities can play a big role in using natural 

resources sustainably.
Everyone can help. Reusing, repairing, and recycling items 
like clothes and plastic reduce pollution and waste. Small actions 

like saving energy and water add up. Learning more, sharing 

ideas, and encouraging others also makes a difference.
In 
conclusion
, sustaining life on Earth needs action from all 
of us
 
Š
 
from local 
communities to global leaders. By working 
together and living responsibly, we can protect this unique 

planet and its future.
Snapshots
 
Our Earth is a unique planet in the solar system as it supports life. 
 
Earth orbits the Sun at a distance where the temperature is 

neither too hot nor too cold, which allows water to exist in liquid 

form. This region is called the habitable zone or Goldilocks zone.
 
Further, the Earth orbits the Sun in a nearly circular orbit ensuring  

that the Earth is not too hot or too cold during any part of the year.
 
The Earth™s gravity is just enough to not let atmosphere escape 

into space. It is also not too high where creatures would be 

crushed by their own weight.
 
Presence of ozone in the atmosphere prevents harmful ultraviolet 

rays from reaching the surface of the Earth.
 
The magnetic field of the Earth shields it from high-energy 

particles that would otherwise hit the Earth and destroy life. 
 
The atmosphere (consisting of air), hydrosphere (consisting of 

water), geosphere (consisting of the solid part of the Earth), and 

biosphere (consisting of life) interact and together sustain life on 

the Earth.
 
Reproduction is essential to ensure the continuity of life on Earth.
 
Reproduction can be either asexual or sexual.
 
In asexual reproduction, a single parent produces new individuals 

that are exact copies of itself.
 
Sexual reproduction make it possible for new features to appear 

in the following generation.
 
In different animals, the development of the zygote into an 

embryo takes place either inside or outside the body.
 
C limate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution are threatening  

life on Earth. Together, these challenges are known as the triple  

planetary crisis.

In sexual reproduction, why are offspring different from 

their parents?
(i)
 
They grow in different climates.
(ii)
 
They eat different food.
(iii)
 
They acquire new instructions after birth.
(iv)
 
They get mixed instructions (genes) from both parents.

You notice tiny green plants growing in cracks on your school 

wall after 
the monsoon. Where do you think the seeds came 
from? What conditions helped these plants grow there?
6.
 
A city has recently cut down a large patch of forest to build 

new roads and buildings. Discuss the possible effects this 

could have on the local climate and biodiversity? How might 

this affect water availability or quality in the area?

A friend says, ﬁThe Earth has always had climate changes 

in the past, so today™s global warming is nothing new.ﬂ How 

would you respond using what you™ve learnt in this and 

other chapters of your science book?
Why ?
When?
How long?
Where?
Why not?

tiny model of Earth for another planet. What must it have to 

support life, and why?
 
India is planning for a challenging lunar mission, 

Chandrayaan-4, which will bring back samples of soil from 

the Moon. If the Moon had water, could plants grow in that 

soil? Think of some experiment that could help you explore 

whether plant growth is possible on the Moon.  
 
Flowers are often brightly coloured and have a pleasant smell. 

How do you think these features help the plant reproduce?
 
Why do animals like fish and frogs lay hundreds or even 

thousands of eggs at a time, while other animals lay only a 

few? What might be the advantages and disadvantages of 

laying so many eggs?
 
Birds like sparrows build nests and care for their eggs and 

chicks, while reptiles like snakes usually lay their eggs and 

leave them without protection. How might this difference in 

parental care affect the chances of survival for the young 

ones in each case?

Curiosity
Inquiry
Exploration
It 's never the end, my friend!
And we have arrived at the final page of our Grade 8 science journey. 
But
 
remember, this is not the end of your exploration. Throughtout the year, 
we hope you have learnt to ask deeper questions, design investigations, and 

think like real scientists do. Whether you wondered about how forces work, 

explored the remarkable balance of our planet, or investigated how ecosystems 

are connected, you™ve already entered the Investigative World of Science.
If you noticed, we left space 
in every chapter for you to ask your own questions. 
What are the things around you that puzzled you? Perhaps you noticed how 

water droplets on a leaf act like a lens, or wondered why different birds have 

different flight patterns. Things that you notice, and the questions you ask about 

them are the very beginning of scientific investigation. This textbook has been 

designed to guide you
 
Š
 
rooted in real observations, yet lifting your imagination 
to fly as high as a kite. But the real adventure belongs to you: keep asking, keep 

experimenting, keep sharing your findings with your friends and teachers.
As you close this book, remember that next year, you will enter the secondary 
stage, where we will go deeper into the world of science. The story will continue 

with more detailed investigations, bigger challenges, and greater discoveries. 

Sonever 
stop wondering, never stop experimenting, and never stop believing 
that your curiosity can change the world. We™ll meet you again on those pages 

Š because in science, it is never the end, my friend!
